    "## Elden Ring Steam Review NLP Sentiment Analysis Project - Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will be conducting an overall sentiment analysis and other NLP tasks using review information from select video games off Steam. <b>Steam</b> is an online video game hosting service and is one of the primary outlets to play video games on PC.\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing some research on how to collect the data to use for this project (let alone any NLP project), I found that there is an existing API to scrape data from Steam, however after running some initial trials of scraping review data, the amount of reviews returned was extremely limited due to the configuration of <i>cursor</i>, which can limit the amount of responses returned to a client in order to hinder large volumes of web traffic (from my understanding of the matter).\n",
    "\n",
    "While looking into building a scraper to obtain game reviews, I happened to stumble across a readily available scraper using Beauitful Soup that parses the cursor from the current page to use in collection of data from the following page. I've chosen to stick with this scraper implementation just to ensure I get as many reviews as possible. Since we're going to analyze reviews from <b>Elden Ring</b>, I would hope it won't become a nuisance to scrape reviews at only one time. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, here is the link to the helpful guide on how to collect video game review data from Steam (where information and code on how to make the scraper comes from): https://andrew-muller.medium.com/scraping-steam-user-reviews-9a43f9e38c92\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project will be to ultimately try to identify, by conducting various NLP tasks, issues and opinions about select games by reviewing game reviews on Steam. Then, based on the topics and insight found, identify and propose solutions to these problems the communities have fomented. Or, at least identify what the strengths and weaknesses of the games are in the communities' eyes (it really depends on the game).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks that may help us here are sentiment analysis and topic modeling to name a few. \n",
    "\n",
    "I felt it would be more beneficial to use games that have released recently, so the content in the reviews is more relevant to the current game state and could relate to how the game gets updated should the developers listen to this outlet of community feedback.\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]A very real review from a Yu-Gi-Oh! vet and ive played since 99 for reference.[/h1]\\n\\nListen ill be blunt, dont come to this game if you thought it was gonna be anything like those old gameboy games we once played with updated graphics and pretty animations. The game as is has lot of balance issues and has a lot of things that need to be added, but its not rushed in any way or form and you can tell they have spent a lot of time polishing things to look great and feel as smooth as possible on launch. That being said it can be smoother and it can be tweaked to fit the current player base. But for the vets that wanted an old school game this isnt for you...YET!\\n\\nThis game can honestly be their next longevity game but they have to add some things and help balance the game so meta decks dont run rampant and people are not compelled to go to the other community based ones. that list is as followed and please add things as you feel needed that way we can hopefully get this the attention it needs and people can see a real review and Konami can see some things that will greatly improve there game!\\n\\n1. Timer needs to be much lower to force people to play there combos faster and know there cards better and ultimately streamline the game, you either know what you are doing and do it quickly or suffer because you sat there for 3 minutes doing absolutely nothing but trying to read your own card. My suggestion is 2-3 minutes per turn which is more than enough time to get your combos out, and with each successful card use it adds 2 seconds which may not sound like a lot but after 10 cards its 20 seconds and can help stabilize longer combos.\\n\\n2. implement 3 other modes outside of ranked mode ,Casuals, Ranked gen 1, and ranked gen 2. Casuals needs no explanation , so for ranked gen one its a ranked mode for all people who wish to test there might against all other who use only cards that involve ritual and fusion cards, nothing past that, no synchro no XYZ nothing, now that doesnt mean they cant use cards like the new blue-eyes max and such but it means they have to fine tune the deck to be more inline with literally just fusion and ritual monsters at their core. and rank two is the same thing but it goes all they way up to synchro and XYZ summoning and doesnt include pendulum and link,thus creating a more 5Ds era of ranked and dueling. By doing this it opens up to a more wide range of players and people can compete without feeling power crept by all the new gen cards and it can even bring in old school people who know how to make a ruthless toon deck.\\n\\n3. A few more ways to earn more in game gems even if it takes a bit longer, also a way to unlock secret packs permanently. for this i believe for more in game gems maybe have weekly missions that people can do throughout the week that give them 1k gems for a 10 pack draw a week, not to much but atleast something to look forward too. now as far as secret packs i believe that once you get 1 of every copy of the featured card on the secret pack list maybe it should be opened permanently or for every 1 time they get every featured card on secret pack maybe its time is extended exactly one week, because at that pint all they need is maybe a couple of copies and if they have a weekly mission that gives them 10 pulls that will literally be there time frame (hopefully that makes sense).\\n\\n4. A Banlist please... good lord having three copies of maxx C is insane and man is that hilarious, i crafted exactly one copy because i know its gonna be limited, but please make an updated banlist and limited list.\\n\\n5. Community engagement, you guys have a chance to make this one of the best games Yu-Gi-Oh! has seen since duelist of roses( dang im getting old) and that can easily be done so long as you listen to the community and watch for the trolls and dont cater to the top 1% and streamers, please understand i dont hate streamers and the 1% because ultimately they help grow the player base, but when you cater to them the game literally slowly but surely dies off and thats when things get to being unbalanced and none new player friendly.\\n\\nThere are more issues but those are the ones off the top of my head and hopefully the community here will add some that they feel is important and i will edit this and add them as i see fit. these next issues are something that can be added for QOL and just to help maybe a few people.\\n\\n6. More animations for boss monsters I.E special attacks and effects for their cards. For example if someone summons blue eyes and they attack it could have its own special attack animation, along with certain spell cards and popular cards having really unique animations to bring the game to life in a new way. like if Halberd Cannon uses its effect you literally get a small animation of him using it etc.\\n\\n7. Some deck features that could be nice like a few more cards sleeves,  a few more search functions and maybe a few more deck slots.\\n\\n8. More in-depth tutorial. Newer players might not skip the tutorial but they also dont get a lot from this one, having a more in-depth one that actually teaches them the ins and outs for cards and uses could improve the longevity of this game.\\n\\nNow this issues is a specific one for those that do like to spend money and dont mind uses mommies credit card.\\n\\n9. You guys seriously need much better gem prices and i mean way better, look at what happen to halo with there prices when they were not good, they had to go back, apologize and revamp half their store, it was crazy. soon you guys will definitely hear the backlash of your gem prices i can assure you that because 25 bucks is 1 10 pack pull and thats insane i would argue that every 16-17 bucks is about 10 packs thus thats like a 7 dollar difference per 10 packs which is 35% i believe. Now while i understand that its new and the game hasnt had any balancing and such and basing things off 10 pack purchase isnt always wise this is again for those whom wish to spend money and after ding math and looking at TCG and OCG card box prices which this should be based off of because its virtual and there are other cosmetics and such people will want to spend money on, its wise to slightly lower the price of gems to help people who do want to spend money and not have them feel ripped off, the happier they feel the more they want to spend Just saying.\\n\\n10. Cosmetics, Yes i know the game just released and they have some cosmetics and such this is just saying that adding more will definitely be a good idea and i believe the price for them is spot on, maybe even a bit cheap but again i digress it a great thing, please add more and maybe even have community votes and such on what can be added.\\n\\n11. Add in character mates. Joey wheeler or Jaden as my mate sounds freaking amazing and i believe they should be 800-1k gems over the other mates and have a few more animations and should have special animations when summoning cards they either used or know bringing the game to life once again in a unique way.\\n\\n\\nIf you have made it this far i thank you and hope that you will add what you believe the game needs to help balance it and give it more life for both the community sake and the game sake.',\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1] 8/10 [/h1]\\n[h1] As a Duel Links former player and a fan of the Yu-Gi-Oh card game, I came to the following conclusion after a brief experience. I hope my opinion helps those who are still on the sidelines. [/h1]\\n\\nIt can be said that this game is one of the best video game works of Yu-Gi-Oh's physical card in recent years. Unlike Duel Links, which focuses on fast-paced combat and nostalgia for anime plots, just like its name, the game's duel rules are the orthodox ocg-rules, which can be said to be one of the most complicated rules in card games. A large number of cards, a wide variety of rules, all flowers are in bloom decks, unexpected situations, and reversal of life after death, are the biggest charms of Yu-Gi-Oh.\\n\\nAt present, the music, scene design, and animation effects of the game are still quite satisfactory. At the same time, new players can build their own deck at a very low cost, which is crucial to the player experience for a card game. The only shortcoming at present is that the cost of building a second deck after building the first deck is relatively high (except for some general-purpose cards). The characteristics of the game are also doomed to the existence of tiered decks. At present, the dominance of mainstream decks over the environment is still unshakable. Let us look forward to how Konami will coordinate and balance in the future.\\n\\nOverall, I'm still optimistic about this game right now. For those new players, the learning cost of ocg-rules is too high, and new players may need a long transition period, and the Duel Link is still suitable for players who like Yu-Gi-Oh's animation and want to have a simple duel.\",\n",

The game is very front heavy with rewards, so by the time you get about halfway through solo and the pass you'll run out of easy gems and have to grind. I built a Darklord deck for fun, but by the time I reached Platinum I was kicking myself for not making a more competitive deck. I'm still struggling against the endless sea of meta decks to reach Platinum 1. Other than the complete lack of content at the end I found the journey fun, and I would recommend the game to anyone who looks at a guide or is ready for the slog.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ve spent a lot of time agonizing over whether I want to put Master Duel as a recommend or dislike in this review. This one\\'s very hesitant; there is a lot to dislike about Master Duel. But, regrettably, I still enjoy it, and know several people who enjoy it and got into YGO through it.\\n\\nMaster Duel is modern YGO in a video game. It\\'s relatively barebones, honestly; there\\'s a simple (and often not-so-perfectly translated) solo mode going over the lore of various cards, there\\'s a best-of-one ranked ladder (that occasionally hosts unique events), you can buy cards and make your deck... yup, that\\'s about it.\\n\\nLet\\'s talk about the elephant in the room first:\\n\\n\\n[b] The Economy and Being F2P(-ish) [/b] \\n\\nThe F2P economy is... generous at times, harsh at others, and often feels like Konami isn\\'t entirely sure what they\\'re doing. Early game gems dry up fast, and later if you\\'re playing optimally you can get enough gems for abouuuut two packs per day, which isn\\'t much. The methods of gaining packs are strange and encourage saving up for a long time and spending all in one inning - or getting impatient and spending money for more. The IRL money-to-game currency exchange is prohibitively expensive - even the absolute best deal, which you can only get for 3 months after starting the game, is a costly ask.\\nBut at the same time, the events that run each month or two are shockingly generous in terms of new gems, and the amount you\\'ll get early is probably enough to make one or two decks either for metagaming or for fun; but if you want to make more than that, gods help you. \\n\\nThe fact that both Actually Powerful In The Metagame decks and Neat For Fun Decks are often around the same cost is a double edged sword, that\\'s for sure.\\n\\n[b] The Presentation [/b] \\n\\nHonestly, despite it all, Master Duel\\'s presentation isn\\'t all that bad. The music is nice (though nowhere as numerous as the selection of Duel Links; although that game has a ton of its own problems), the graphics are engaging enough, and it\\'s far more easy to understand what\\'s going on by watching it than the card game is IRL.\\nI\\'ve had a lot of friends tell me that even when they\\'re losing games in Master Duel, they\\'re still enjoying it and understanding what\\'s going on, so that\\'s definitely a good sign.\\nThe Solo Mode is a neat series of trying various loaner decks, and the story of various card groups is neat, but the translation is far from the neatest, and it often feels like Konami didn\\'t feel to put all that much work into that part. \\n(Seriously, they mistranslated \"Dark Magician\" - strong contender for the MOST iconic card in the game - as \"Dark Spellian\" for a bit. Find-And-Replace algorithms moment.)\\n\\n[b] Gameplay and the Metagame [/b] \\n\\nWe can\\'t really talk about Master Duel without talking about YGO proper.\\nYu-Gi-Oh! is... a messy game. Decades of power creep in a format without rotation has left many games often decided by turn 1/2.\\nThis isn\\'t necessarily a bad thing! Games in older YGO formats were often just as unbalanced. But it\\'s not for everyone, and when the solo content is finite and playing on Ranked Duel is essentially required to earn gems after a while, the metagame needs to be addressed.\\nThe fact that games don\\'t include the side deck means several decks in Master Duel can essentially make something unfair that, unless you have the very specific counter to, you lose to on the spot. (Lookin\\' at you, D.D. Dynamite Burn and Skill Drain Eldlich. Hell, this is coming from a non-floodgate Eldlich player, even!). It can be frustrating, it can be unfair.\\n\\nNonetheless, there are somehow - perhaps accidentally - diamonds in the rough of all this. The current N/R Festival event, which uses only cards available for essentially no cost, has a neat format and is easily accessible - though even its meta still has a few of its own problems.\\n\\nThere\\'s ways to play with friends, but the function behind it is quite janky. \\n\\n[b] Final Thoughts [/b] \\n\\nMaster Duel... sure exists. It\\'s as messy as the card game itself, many of its successes feel like accidentally stumbling into good ideas, and I worry that the economy or game might only grow worse as time passes.\\n\\nBut for now? I\\'ve enjoyed it! I\\'ve enjoyed playing with friends, I liked the solo mode, the current N/R Festival is delightful, and I even enjoy ranked duels more than I\\'d expect.\\n\\nPlay it if you want, I guess. Don\\'t spend money on it though lmao',\n",

       "  'review': 'I want to like Yugioh very badly. Time and time again over the last like 8 or so years I always find myself coming back because this game has so much potential, but seems to consistently fall short (and by a lot) in that regard. And this isn\\'t a problem with Master Duels, it\\'s a problem with the entire game and how Konami goes about it.\\n\\nYou want to not play at a severe disadvantage? Play 1 of a handful or top-tier meta decks. Or play cheap, unfair cards that prevent your opponent from playing their deck and having fun.\\n\\nYou want to be creative and come up with your own decks? Cool. You can. But you better be good at it or you\\'re going to lose constantly. But losing constantly isn\\'t even the only issue. If you\\'re actually decent at being creative and making your own decks, AND if you\\'re a decent player, you may even stand a decent shot at taking down some of those top-tier meta decks sometimes. And now, instead of the problem being losing, the problem is winning (and not being able to be demoted).\\n\\nLet\\'s say you outplay or get lucky and get a few win streaks, cool, now you got promoted to platinum or gold. Buuuuut now you can\\'t get demoted back to gold or silver. And just by nature of being in the higher bracket of ranked, you\\'re facing more and more top-tier meta decks. You can lose to these decks 20 times in a row, and you STILL won\\'t be demoted (and thus, more likely to face decks/players closer to your level). You\\'re literally trapped in meta hell just because YOU had decent original ideas and just because you were able to win and outplay despite being disadvantaged by playing non-meta decks.\\n\\nAnd not only is the issue with these top-tier meta decks being absolutely busted, but there\\'s no variety in these upper ranked brackets. It\\'s the same half a dozen to a dozen decks virtually (no pun intended) every single time. The simple fact of playing the same decks all the time is incredibly boring.\\n\\nAnd even just the lack of variety being boring isn\\'t the only issue, the state of the game is. All these negates preventing your opponent from doing anything is just ridiculous. Not to mention cheap cards that don\\'t inhibit one deck but inhibit nearly all other decks, like Skill Drain, Gozen Match, Imperial Order, Rivalry of Warlords, Summoning Circle, Dimensional Fissure, and a number of other cards make the game UNFUN to play against (unless you happen to get lucky and play a deck like your opponent\\'s that happens to not be inhibited by that card).\\n\\nAnd like many other people have mentioned, the horrendously long turns it takes your opponent on turn one, where you\\'re waiting god knows how long just to get a chance to play the game (and then when you finally do, you face numerous negates). And I can hear it now \"just play Ash, Max C, Nibiru, Crossout, Impermanence, and Forbidden Droplet.\" If your response to criticism of the game is to indirectly mandate the use of several cards, then the game isn\\'t worth defending. If the game forces you to play a number of specific cards just to be minimally viable, you\\'re not playing your own game, you\\'re playing the game they\\'re forcing you to play. This is a DECK BUILDING GAME, not a \"here we made a deck for you, go do exactly as we tell you to do\" game. No cards should be indirectly required just to play the game.\\n\\nAnd then there\\'s also those (frequent) times where the duel is more or less even, and then out of no where your opponent summons a zillion monsters and/or monsters with a zillion attack and they just OTK (one-turn-kill) you. And often times this just happens on the second turn, before any sort of back-and-forth gameplay even happens. The game ending in one turn is not fun, here most definitely be some back-and-forth. The amount of things wrong with this game is astonishing, and they\\'ve been wrong for quite a long time at this point. I\\'m very surprised it hasn\\'t been fixed. I guess the game is so well established that idiots like me keep coming back and devoting time to it that Konami doesn\\'t actually have to facilitate a healthy game-state, people will just come here to support it regardless.\\n\\nYugioh could be good, but it\\'s consistently bad. And I\\'m still probably going to try to play it until one day I give up on Yugioh for the 9th time.',\n",

       "  'review': 'So I\\'ve been playing this game since launch, and I enjoy it for the most part. But the honey moon is over and it\\'s starting to get bad. I knew f2p currency was going to be bottlenecked after the first days, it\\'s a \"gacha\" game after all, but seeing that you don\\'t even get rewards from ranked reset is absurd. I feel like I\\'m being punished for getting to Platinum, since I didn\\'t get a reward for the reset and I\\'m losing out on all the gems from Beginner to Gold ranks. \\n\\nLogin rewards are also kinda bad, since they should give you more gems per day to keep players logging in rather than decreasing the amount as days go by. Add to that that there\\'s not even a casual mode, which is nuts. I feel like they\\'re dropping the ball, they should\\'ve done better taking into account how the game exploded in popularity.\\n\\nI\\'ll keep playing it to see how it goes, I think the first event will be the break point. If you really want to play it look for a video on how to spend your gems, you\\'ll not regret it like I did.\\n\\nEditing my review a day later, because they addressed the ranked situation and are going to compensate players. Still gonna mantain my not recommended, for now that is, until I see what the event is all about and because I still stand by my other points, such as no casual mode.\\n\\nFinal? edit: Event was pretty nice. Gave a lot of rewards and banned a lot of annoying cards, and aside from self-burn decks I got to see some cool variety and had fun.\\n\\nI have to say, the game still needs some tweaking. It needs that casual play, and duel rooms are not it. It probably won\\'t change the other stuff I had problems with, like rewards being given less and less as you progress because gacha, but I\\'m hoping events will be constant and varied.\\n\\nEdit to end all edits: game is still pretty bad. No new cosmetics, no rank rewards, no ban lists, events give gems and no other cool stuff (like, cosmetics, again), it\\'s just really boring now.',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1] Great because it\\'s Yu-Gi-Oh! Bad because it\\'s Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. [/h1]\\n\\nSince most other reviews cover the gameplay aspect (and I was forced to cut most things due to hitting the character limit), I\\'ll just talk about other aspects of the game that I find problematic.\\n\\n[b] Amount of content/reward and potential play duration [/b]\\n\\nI...honestly think this is the biggest topic to tackle here, I\\'ve read plenty of reviews praising the generosity of Konami and all, but unfortunately I\\'ll have to warn you that all they\\'ve done is give the bare minimum to hook you in and extend the already short honeymoon phase you\\'ll have with this game. Why? At first, you\\'ll be greeted by tons of free in-game currency, then you\\'ll also meet the \"duel pass\", a typical battle pass you see in many mobile and even pc games nowadays that are usually paid for with real money. \\n\\nHowever, in yugioh, what\\'s praiseworthy is that there is no separate currency (gold, coins, anything) and it\\'s all just from their gems, so what does this mean? Yep, the duel pass can be purchased with the free gems you get by playing the game and doing missions, which is almost unheard of in most games so that\\'s awesome. \\n\\nSolo missions? Yeah, you get to sink in quite a bit of time playing a form of campaign/mission mode and the mission rewards are very, very generous. Now you may be wondering - \"Then what do you mean by short honeymoon phase and bare minimum to hook you in?\". After a couple days of fun grinding solo missions and ranked for rewards, you\\'ll quickly start noticing how the rewards you get decrease [i] exponentially [/i] over time and the things you can do in the game also equally run out within a matter of just a few days or maybe a week or two at best if you don\\'t no life it. Almost all of my friends have started the game with me on release and everybody exhausted their resources as well as their options for meaningful rewards almost entirely. And the duel/battle pass? You reach the max level of it also within a few days, yet the reward period lasts for more than a couple months..\\n\\nWhat seems incredibly backwards to me is how their rewards decrease exponentially each passing day. The login rewards for example start out at gems enough to buy 10 packs, then just a bit later instead of increasing it actually.. gets reduced to half.. then decreases again.. this is also limited to 7 days so it\\'s an incredibly finite source of income and the same applies to solo mission rewards. Here is where it started reminding me of Genshin Impact, a game that was similarly released prematurely without enough content for players whatsoever that resembles something that\\'s in alpha stage of development, with an incredibly forced level of limited resources and only a short burst of rewards at the start to hook you in, with not enough incentive to continue playing once you\\'ve reached the end point. Oh, did I mention the daily missions in this game give you so little that it makes you consider taking a minimum wage part time job instead and spend money for more gems in that time?\\n\\nThe solo missions can be finished within a day, platinum in ranked can also be achieved within a day or two if you grind a bit, then suddenly you\\'re left there with nothing to do. But you may argue - \"Then just create different decks and have fun in ladder or with friends!\". Oh, oh I wish I could, I personally bought the entire set of gem bundles available and well... it\\'s now time to transition to the next topic.\\n\\n[b] Deck creation, dealing with the finite resources and its disassembly system [/b]\\n\\nThe game got even more hype because it was confirmed that you can craft cards you want - disassembling cards you don\\'t need and use their fragments as material to craft specific cards for your deck. This is on paper an amazing system, since you don\\'t rely so heavily on card packs and pure rng to somehow give you the cards you need (especially when the standard pack currently has 6750 packs and you get cards randomly from this massive pool). \\n\\nHowever, this system exists in the card game Shadowverse and they\\'ve done a great job at it by making it easy for players to craft various decks they like, so I\\'ll be comparing it directly to the system in that game. In Shadowverse, vials/CP(crafting points) are one single currency to craft any rarity card you want, but in master duel... each rarity has a separate CP, meaning that you need to disassemble UR cards to create UR cards, at the rate of 3 disassembled URs for one single UR..yeah.. and the chance of dropping a UR is 2.5% (actually not bad at all for a gacha, especially since single packs contain multiple cards), but with this CP system there are obviously some problems. \\n\\nBesides the split up currencies, what adds salt to the wounds is the fact that yugioh revolves largely around combos and therefore negations, meaning that you\\'ll need a lot of base cards that are similarly used across most decks, such as maxx c, consequently ash blossom, etc... All of which are, yep, you guessed it, Ultimate Rare. If you tried creating a deck you may have noticed an interesting pattern, cards that are obvious to be popular to craft are very very likely to be made UR... I sure wonder why Konami. \\n\\nConsequently, the cost of making a single deck is so ridiculously high compared to other card games, that you\\'d almost need to all in your resources on maximum one or two decks before you\\'re completely sucked dry, unless you\\'re like me and bought all the premium gem bundles. Yeah, I barely managed to make 3 whole decks with those expensive bundles AND the free gems obtained combined, meanwhile my F2P friends are all hovering around 1-2 usable decks with the free rewards. \\n\\nThere is no normal matchmaking mode either, just a ranked matchmaking slapped on which completely ignores the casual crowd that just wants to play some yugioh for nostalgia sake with their favorite decks, instead of being forced to play meta against tryhards in ranked, which is another quite backwards thing they did. But I have this sneaking suspicion that they did this because of how Valve\\'s card game \"Artifact\" went down due to a lack of proper ranked matchmaking, although I believe neither is correct as both games failed to cater to both audiences in the end.\\n\\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\\n\\nUltimately, I\\'ll have to loop back to the header of this whole review. Yu-Gi-Oh! is great, this game is not. If it wasn\\'t for the deep love I have for yugioh I wouldn\\'t have touched this game or at least, dropped it by now. However, you can argue that this is still way too early to judge, which I do agree with, so we\\'ll have to wait and see. The greyed out event match button besides the rank match button and other obviously soon to come features are something I\\'ll keep an eye out for. \\n\\nAs of now, I cannot recommend the game in its current state and would say that you should wait until we get more news on how they\\'ll do things from here on out to judge whether they want to get on the right track or have this game become another stain on Konami\\'s reputation.\\n\\nAlso, after all this doomscrolling you went through, I\\'m terribly sorry but there is a frightening detail I need to point out... If you go to the Submenu -> Record of Gems Obtained, you\\'ll see two split up numbers...for the gems.. \"Free Gems Owned\" and \"Paid Gems Owned\", what do you guys think it means? I hope I\\'m wrong, I really do, but from my experience this opens up potential for this \"generous\" Konami to really put the nail in the coffin by locking certain shop items explicitly behind the said \"Paid Gems\" currency. \\nHave a good night\\'s sleep and that\\'s where my review ends.\\n\\nThank you for reading and I truly hope the game makes it long-run.',\n",

Outside of that, I would just say don't even bother.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Great AFK game. Start duel and if you're 2nd, you can go read a book, watch a movie, and make a meal. Come back and it might be your turn.   10,000 unique cards and only 5% of those are used.  Spend hours building a deck and crafting. Go into duel. Lose coin flip. Wait 30 minutes for opponent to summon entire deck.  Place monster > destroyed, place spell > negated, special summon > returned to hand. End turn and lose.  Best of 1 so can't build alternative deck for counters.  Cost of decks is too high for little resources gained from story and crafting.  \\n\\nAt this time I'd probably recommend against this game or don't keep your expectations high.  If you don't play one of the handful of meta decks used, you won't have a good time.  Unless you're a masochist, then ignore everything I've said and fuck it enjoy your time.  Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Friendly review from an old yugioh fan for other old yugioh fans. This game is not for you and when i say \"this game\" i actually don\\'t mean master duel, I mean yugioh in general.\\n\\nIf i was reviewing this game as a modern yugioh fan with all the knowledge of current cards and meta then yes this game is a big thumbs up. Instead im reviewing this in the eyes of someone who misses the old days of yugioh where the card game had an emphasis on fun and not 10 minute rounds to set up a win in one or two turns (i literally was watching youtube as the person i was competing against finished their turn).\\n\\nI was very excited for this game when i first saw it announced. I followed any news and watched the videos so i KNEW it was going to be tailored around modern yugioh rules, however, I was HOPING for more classic cards and maybe a bunch of classic decks at launch, that way people like me could set up private lobbies for old casual yugioh fun but, that doesn\\'t exist yet. Speaking of the private lobbies or \"deck rooms;\" more flexible customizing needs to be added that way players can have full control of how the lobby is set up and people browsing those lobbies have more info on what/who the lobby is for.\\n\\nSomehow MTG has become more casual than yugioh which is mind blowing to me. Also, a simple fix for all the competitive deck building games is to have matchmaking be based on the cards rather then the player. I could be the number one ranked player in the game but, if i was queued with a starter deck then i should only play other players with starter decks and vice versa.\\n\\ntl,dr; this game is great for new yugioh players and very competitive players, but if you are returning to yugioh hoping for those classic times dueling for fun then you must look elsewhere until more control to the deck rooms is added as well as classic decks or better matchmaking.\\n\\nEdit; after playing an additional 20 hours of the game to clear the solo missions (haven\\'t 100% it yet) and use the generous beginning gems they give you to open some packs and build some decks I am having fun with the game, however; I still stand by my original review above. Regarding the solo mode: it is okay, they added fun stories or \"scenarios\" that explain the lore of certain archetypes then have you do a practice duel with said archetype that teach you the *very* basic ideas of the archetype and then after completing that you go on to some duels that you can complete using your own deck or a loaner of the scenario archetype.\\n\\nSpeaking of story mode and the scenarios; these are very cool and kind of fun and I\\'d like to see more added, but unfortunately the \"practice\" you do before the duels literally has you complete a guided combo (ONE combo) from the archetype and then sends you to figure out the rest on your own. I think this could have been improved by having a couple guided practices explaining a few of the different combos that an archetype can pull off.\\n\\nAgain: I stand by my original review and add that solo mode, while improvable, is pretty fun. Also, add a bot mode, like seriously every card game has one.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I have played some games for 1000 hours whether in steam or other platforms. Have clocked Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Links past 1300 hours mark as of this writing. Have played old YGO games in various PS consoles, watched the anime, collect some cards, am a fan. So 75 hours in, I have to ask myself, am I having fun in Master Duel? The answer is NO.\\n\\nBecause most of 75 hours, I kid you not, is spent on WAITING FOR THE OTHER PLAYER TO FINISH THEIR TURNS.  There will be time I will be hitting my head on the keyword WAITING for my turn. No joke, honest feedback, I have spent while waiting for my turns to actually play Master Duel - Have completed watching hours long videos, afk gone to the toilet with no rush knowing it would still not be my turn when I come back, made myself and finish eating sandwiches while waiting, not playing, swept the floor and did general house chores, did some general excerises and so on. 75 hours in, which is enough time to complete a meaty JRPG game, I've reflected, most of the time in the game have been spent WAITING for my turns to actually play the game and the reason why I CANNOT RECOMMEND MASTER DUEL.\\n\\nTo be fair Master Duel, off the bat it offers a layered card game with thousands of easily accessible cards. You can, with effort, build yourself competitive, even fun decks just by playing and being rewarded for playing. So props to the devs.\\n\\nBut in terms of game design/game flow, when I as a player, am spending most of my time in the game WAITING for my turns to actually play the game, I cannot recommend even if I am a fan of the IP. Too Much Waiting. Unfortunately this is baked into the cake in terms of game flow when playing Master Duel.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Game is great, current meta of the game sucks the fun out of playing ranked. I wish we had other modes to play, perhaps a legacy card mode for ranked. I hope that with event duels they take the opportunity to limit allowed cards for this mode to create creative limited builds for the event. If we could skip the tutorials for decks in solo that would be fantastic as it's always something I dread to deal with. They need to reduce the turn limit time as currently there is so much time given to players where basically there is 5 mins of set up and likely to just one turn kill you. I hope in the future we could get anime stories to play through in solo. For anyone who doesn't know if you create a SR or UR of a card in a pack it unlocks the secret pack. This should really be explained more clearly otherwise I can imagine players buying the master packs in hopes of trying to get the secret pack.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'This is it. This is the game yugioh players have all been waiting for. This is not a knockoff game like Duel Links. This is an actual official online yugioh videogame of the ACTUAL game. It has all of the mechanics. It has all the cards. THIS IS THE REAL GAME\\n\\nThere are many ways of playing yugioh online, i.e the manual simulators (like DuelingBook) as well as the rules enforced programs/sites (I used to use DuelingNexus when I was active). You don\\'t *have* to play this game, you can very well continue playing on whatever site/program you were using before as you were, so this becoming a thing is sort of a pleasant surprise. Despite the already available \\'availability\\' of yugioh, Master Duel has proven to be extremely popular when it released - Causing a store issue of people unable to receive cards after buying them because of an \"increase in traffic\" (which was swiftly fixed and affected users compensated) as well as a notice given to everyone along the lines of \\'hey guys, we expect a ton of people to start logging in at the same time after the maintenance ends, so you might not be able to get in right away after the maintenance, we will be staggering the logins (cause there\\'s so many of you)\\'.\\n\\nMaybe it\\'s because it\\'s on steam, and on a lot of other platforms other than pc for that matter. Maybe it\\'s because a lot of players who used to play in the past are discovering this and giving yugioh another spin. Maybe it\\'s the power of Master Duel\\'s officialness. I don\\'t know for sure, but my guess is it\\'s a combination of all of that. And here we have it. Master Duel can be another avenue for you to enjoy the game.\\n\\nOther than the above, there\\'s nothing more I have to say to any established yugioh players here. Instead I think the review has to be directed towards new or inexperienced players, or older players experiencing these new cards and mechanics for the first time. For these players there are more things worth mentioning.\\n\\nThe game of Yugioh has been around for more than 10 years. There are now over 10,000 cards in Master Duel. The trading card game releases sets of new physical cards about after every few months or so. The game is evolving and of course has evolved throughout so long of the game\\'s history. After 10 years of a card game\\'s existence, you can imagine that the game\\'s rules and mechanics have increased in both number and complexity. It\\'s still easy to grasp the basics, but there is a lot to wrap your head around before you get a full comprehensive understanding of all the rules and advanced mechanics (e.g. how Chains work & Activation/Resolution, Problem Solving Card Text structure, when Simultaneous Effects Go On Chain, obscure interactions between specific cards, etc).\\n\\nOn steam, you may come across statements like \\'my opponent\\'s turn takes too long\\', \\'my opponent summons too many monsters and kills me in one turn\\', and \\'playing yugioh is similar to playing solitaire\\' (you can see this by scrolling down and skimming over the negative reviews which is what I\\'ve just done to get these examples). I suspect these sentiments are more held by normal steam users or e.g. someone just looking for a card game to play online, rather than the active players of the game or booked up tournament players for whom there is no need for me to expound my review for. While these may be legitimate concerns to a new player, these are problems addressed to Yugioh: The Card Game instead of the independent value of Master Duel in itself, and are of little to no concern to the latter mentioned established population of players who already know everything about the game.\\n\\nWhat this does show though, is that there IS a learning curve to modern yugioh, and that perhaps this game is not for everyone. For a gamer taking yugioh dueling purely as a gaming experience, (you can, if not just by reading others\\' reviews of Master Duel, conclude that) it is an easy task to gauge whether or not this game is right for you.\\n\\nNavigating all this yugioh stuff as a new player can be difficult and daunting. If you only stick around the steam discussions and reviews section for too long, around sentiments about losing too fast, WINNING too fast, people deciding to surrender, people deciding NOT to surrender, as well as turns taking too long despite others disliking the number of turns being too SHORT - You\\'ll probably end up saying some permutation of those things as well, and quit. Yugioh is better with a friend. Hang out with a friend who\\'s been into the game and knows what they\\'re doing. They\\'ll teach you the ropes, recommend a few good deck archetypes to play, and set you off on the right track.\\n\\nDon\\'t sweat it if you initially can\\'t win in multiplayer/ranked. Again this card game has been around for 10 years. There are bound to be veterans and other players with varying levels of experience. Don\\'t mind the starter decks (it doesn\\'t matter which starter deck you choose, they\\'re all bad). It\\'s about the gems - They give you a bunch of gems and this is good because YOU decide what packs you buy that contain the cards you want with your gems, and use crafting materials out of the rest of the cards you didn\\'t want to obtain ANY card in the game. Out of the 10,000+ cards there are maybe only 1,000+ cards that are useful enough to see play, and only about 10+ different deck archetypes you might ever want to try out throughout your dueling career. You can easily build 2 to 3 different decks with the gems you receive for signing up and for your first few plays.\\n\\nOne word of caution: If I could only give one piece of advice to my friend who\\'s new to the game, my advice would be to choose your deck wisely. 1,000 playable cards means there are 9,000 useless cards. You should take extra care to make sure that the deck you want to get because you think is good, is in fact actually good, so you won\\'t regret your decisions later.\\n\\nAs much as I\\'ve written in this review already, some part of me thinks this review shouldn\\'t be over, and I even think I\\'ve barely begun to review Master Duel, like, right?? But it does play Yugioh: The Card Game, and there are a lot of things you can say about yugioh (the card game). Like at this point you can bet there is always [i]someone[/i], [i]somewhere[/i], who is very vocal about [i]something[/i], whether it be a certain card or deck or type of opponent or what they had for lunch or what have you. There\\'s just a lot of things you can say about a 10 year old game like yugioh.\\n\\nWell, what do I have to say...? We got an actual definitive online cross platform game of real modern yugioh as it is actually played. Welcome to Yugioh Master Duel. After 9 years of development, we hope it was worth the wait.\\n\\nEDIT: THE SOLO MODE IS SO ENJOYABLE. I forgot to say this in my initial writeup and this review is so long so I\\'ll just put this here. Please keep adding to the solo mode. And make the World Chalice arc an anime',\n",

       "  'review': 'Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel is a great game when you have friends and it\\'s a terrible choice if you are a solo player. I am not complaining about new players who need a bit longer to think about their turns. But slow players are a huge problem. If they go on like this, they will kill multiplayer eventually. You are wasting minutes watching the opponent do nothing beyond playing a land every turn for their first turns. Unacceptable time limit in each turn  makes \"Ranked Games\" unplayable.\\n\\nWhy do people copy paste others decks? If they have absolutely no idea how these decks are working. It\\'s very annoying!!\\n\\nIf you have friends who are willing to play with You.. well.. You know, test many decks, do some crazy summons, share interesting builds - You will have a lot fun!!  The game is extremely enjoyable with friends. After all, that\\'s the whole purpose of multiplayer games – for players to enjoy that experience together. \\n\\nThe crafting system is very simple. You can get many cards in a very short time which is very awesome and that would be the biggest plus. \\n\\nThere are many interesting solo missions and these missions will entertain you greatly.\\n\\nUnfortunately.. I will leave a negative review. There are some things I don\\'t like:\\n\\n- Ranked Games are unplayable. That\\'s the fact!\\n-  \"Practice games\" are very slow. There\\'s no option to skip them\\n-  The music is also awful. \\n-  You can not add banned cards to your deck. Other Yu-Gi-Oh! games like \"Legacy of the Duelist\" did not have this.  You could add even 3x Forbidden cards to your deck. \\n-  Fullscreen issues.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Yugioh is not an enjoyable game to play competitively. Played for many years, finally quit, and then this client comes out. Decided to try it again, and the same issues I quit the game for are still there. Turns take years, the interaction in the game is designed to prevent your opponent from playing, and every board you set up that isn't doing that is playing incorrectly. Even creating your deck with these things in mind, if you don't draw hand traps to prevent your opponent from setting up their unbreakable board on turn one, the board they set up prevents you from playing 3-4 cards on average before you can actually start dismantling it. Comes down to the coin flip, and any competitive game decided on a coin flip before you start playing is not worth your time. It's very fun if you have friends who agree on a power level for the decks, but any card game is fun that way, and there are other card games that are more fun competitively than this, so don't invest money or time.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Master duel is a fun experience among friends and in its single player mode, however the MP or \"Duel\" mode as its called is where the game starts to lose its appeal for long term play sessions. If you not a competitive Yu-Gi-Oh player the mode should be fun until you hit about gold rank and then its starts to get more frustrating as most decks you\\'ll play will be built with a meta in mind therefore taking all the fun of building your own deck out of the game and forcing you into using a more meta deck just to get ranked higher. Despite that if you play private lobbies with your friends or the single player mode the game is very fun and can have you playing for hours on end, on top of that the game gives you access to most of the cards currently available within the TCG and direct ways to obtain the cards you want so you can build whatever deck your heart desires without spending any real money. Konami has also been updating the game with new single player duels that focus on specific archetypes and their lore which adds more playable to the single player mode aside from playing it to unlock certain cards and rewards. Overall for a free to play game you have nothing to lose by giving this game a shot, but your hoping to use a non meta deck in online MP your most likely going to be disappointed.',\n",

This set introduced the Infernoids, a series of monsters that can Special Summon themselves to the field by banishing other Infernoids from either the hand or graveyard. Notable cards in set include Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss, Qliphort Monolith, Uni-Zombie, Nephe Shaddoll Fusion, and a card that would bolster Satellarknight to combat the Burning Abyss Shaddoll meta, Stellarknight Constellar Diamond. In this series, both Nyhmnim and myself will be opening 24 booster packs or 1 box of a core Yu-Gi-Oh! booster set. We will build a deck and play a best 2 out of 3, and the winner will receive a small prize to upgrade their deck. HOWEVER! Each episode, we will open another box of the next set that was released moving in chronological order, constantly upgrading our decks before dueling each other at the end of each episode.

       "  'review': '[h1][u]Quick Overview[/u][/h1]\\nYugioh: Master Duels offers fans of the franchise another dive back into the world of card games. While the story mode isn’t as rich as I would like, as a whole, it still provides plenty for free-to-play players to enjoy, and is a good introduction to the series for beginners since it has a good tutorial about the various mechanics of a typical duel. \\n\\n[table][tr][td][h1]Pros 👍[/h1] [list][*]F2P friendly[*]Elaborate deck construction [*]Can exchange old cards for new ones[*]Generous amount of in-game currency to start with[*] PvP is stable[/list][/td][td][h1]Cons 👎[/h1][list][*]Barebones storyline[*]AI can get stuck in a summoning loop[*]Duels can be longer than usual[*]In-game currency is expensive[/list] [/td][/tr][/table][table][tr][td][b]PC Specs: RTX 2070 Super |i7 4790S |12 GB RAM |Playing at 1440p resolution[/b][/td][td][b]Average Playtime:5-10+ Hours[/b][/td][/tr][/table]\\n[quote]Follow our Curator page,[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41449676/] Summit Reviews [/url], to see more high-quality reviews regularly.[/quote]\\n[h1][u] Gist of the Story[/u][/h1]\\nDiffering from previous games, the story is told in various “one-shot scenarios” depicting the lore of certain duel monsters, like the “Pyroxene Warriors,” and the “Karakuri.” These alternate worlds contain different stories surrounding duel monsters in constant war with each other and humans. \\n\\n[b][u]My thoughts[/u][/b]\\nIn a weird turn of events, we don’t visit the major parts that occurred in the anime. No dueling with the iconic Seto Kaiba or hanging out in the schoolyard with Yuki Juudai in Duel Academy. This decision would have been a breath of fresh air because I’ve been playing these kinds since the GBA and going through the same scenes over and over like in DBZ can be tiresome, but the stories they included here are barebones. I understand you don’t play YGO for the story, but I was intrigued with the lore of certain focused cards, but it was never expanded on, and there isn’t even dialogue. \\n\\n[h1][u]Gameplay[/u][/h1]\\n[b][u]Duels[/u][/b]\\nSolo and multiplayer consists of 1 vs. 1 turn-based battle, and each duelist has 8000 life points, which is the amount of health you must deplete to win. Each player will have a standard 40-60 cards, with a varying degree of spells, traps, and monster cards. Monsters with the highest attack will usually win, but you can always shift the tide of the battle with a well-timed spell card that buffs your monster’s attack or trap cards like “Mirror Force” that destroys the opponent’s monsters in attack position. In Solo mode, you will fight against an AI and their themed deck, and they’re not too difficult. You will be able to choose to fight with your cards or a pre-built deck, called “structured decks,” to try out. I like to roll with dragons and sometimes with a themed deck consisting of “Elemental Heroes,” so I must include supporting spells and traps that synchronize well with these cards. Working out what’s best for you and the moment is part of the puzzle with card games, and that’s what I love about them. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2751388914\\n[b][u]Summoning[/u][/b]\\nThere are a variety of ways to place monsters on the field, like “Special and “Tribute” summons or more advanced ones, such as “Synchro” and “Pendulum”. I don’t have room to write out a comprehensive explanation, but essentially you need ingredients, usually in the form of monster or spell cards, to bring out a more powerful creature on the field. For example, in “Synchro” you will normally need to sacrifice a “tuner” and a normal monster on the field. You will always see the description on the card, so you don’t have to guess what they are. In the case of special summons, trap cards like “Call of Haunted” and spells like “Monster Reborn” can bring back defeated monsters from the grave.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2751369488\\nI happen to like Synchro and special summons, especially when I have a “Blue Eyes” themed deck, so my playstyle is mostly special summoning my feature card, “The Blue Eyes White Dragon,” who is an 8-star monster. 6 star and higher requires a certain amount of monsters to sacrifice, and in the case of old Blue Eyes, it needs 2 tributes, but since my whole objective is flooding the field with my dragon, I can simply use a monster card like “Maiden with Eyes of Blue” to bring it out if she is ever destroyed. I know it can be quite overwhelming, especially if you’re new or haven’t been playing YGO in quite some time, but fortunately, the game does offer a tutorial and practice fights using pre-built decks focusing on these summoning styles during “Solo” mode until you get the hang of it.\\n\\n[b][u]Booster Packs[/u][/b]\\nIf you’re looking to strengthen your deck, or just want new cards, you can purchase booster packs at the in-game card shop. I do find that the game supplements you with a good amount of currency, in the form of crystals, to start with, but it does taper off as you continue. “Solo” mode can also give you crystals plus new cards and structure decks, while multiplayer allows you to grind crystals for every match won. I haven’t had any issues with getting the cards I want, but they’re so many that I have no choice but to be highly specific on what I want.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2751366973\\nI do like the system where you can dismantle your excess cards and exchange them for new ones. It’s great if you’re searching for a card that you can’t seem to get in a booster pack. There is also the ability to buy crystals with real money, but they’re expensive, so I am willing to grind for a bit.\\n\\n[b][u]PvP[/u][/b]\\nIn this mode, you can challenge either random duelists around the world or invite your friends for a quick match. I haven’t had problems connecting with players and usually find someone in seconds. If you’re a beginner, and you hop on ranked matches, chances are you might come across a duelist who takes 10 minutes or more to summon 2 cards on the field. This also happens in solo play where the AI is caught on a loop using “Link” summons, but they’re programmed that way. I feel like when an actual human does it, it’s obnoxious because they’re just stalling time so that the other player surrenders. I’ve seen this a few times, and I just surrender to find a new match. I do not have the patience of a saint, so I hope that a stricter time limit is implemented because sitting for 10 minutes or more is terrible, and a waste of time. \\n\\n[h1][u]Graphics and Technical Issues[/u][/h1]\\n\\nThere’s not much in the graphics department since it’s just an arena where you place cards on, but the setup is presented well enough, and depending on who you are fighting, it changes alongside the music that’s playing. Special monsters like “The Dark Magician” receive a 3D model cutscene when they’re placed on the field due to their importance, and it’s cool to see them take form. What I would love is for monsters to have 3D models while they’re on the field no matter who they are, but I understand that would take more effort considering there are thousands of cards available.\\n\\nThe game doesn’t have a ton of graphical settings besides resolution, but it has never crashed on me, and the frame rate is 60 FPS no matter what is happening. I do find it annoying that it always launches in“windowed mode” even after changing it, but that’s just a nitpick, and does not affect anything. \\n\\n[h1][u]Wrap Up[/u][/h1]\\nI finished solo mode in about 15 hours since I did the extra objectives, but you can probably breeze through it if you focus on the main path in 5-6 hours because they’re not too difficult. All in all, it’s not a bad F2p game, and fans of card games will find something to love.',\n",

Many years have passed since then and I see this for free on the store, so I give it a go for a couple of hours, decide to make a deck from cards I remember way back when and jump into a couple of games.\\n\\nHm, that's odd, It's my opponent's very first turn and after about 5 minutes of waiting he has chained all sorts of combinations leaving his entire side stacked with insanely powerful cards. I'm able to normal summon a card and then promptly get beaten straight afterwards.\\n\\nLOL I tried building a deck with some newer cards too afterwards but I just don't understand all of this nonsense, I'd have to put in hundreds of hours to even come up with even half the combos I saw against me playing. I don't have the time or patience for that.\\n\\nI get it. Really. It's a me problem. The game is not for me anymore, I am out of touch and old. I probably sucked when I was young too LOL.

       "  'review': 'I\\'ll be honest, the game itself is great. Well made, few errors I\\'ve ever encountered, a solid if short Solo Mode, honestly one of Konami\\'s best, recent games.\\n\\nThe \"Gem Economy\" is an absolute improvement over Konami\\'s other F2P Yu-Gi-Oh! game. Each pack is double the price of \"gems\", but gems are far more abundant (at least, they are initially) and easy to obtain (again, initially) without spending anything, and if you\\'re lacking cards, you can get them directly with these little \"rarity tokens\" you get by breaking down cards of a certain rarity. I will say that getting certain kinds of \"tokens\" are much harder to get than others, but eh, still an improvement.\\n\\nThe primary reason I\\'m putting it down, and will rarely touch it again, is the same reason I\\'ve always put down other Yu-Gi-Oh! simulation games in the past: the people who play it.\\n\\nDon\\'t bother playing a deck you actually LIKE. If you\\'re not running a deck that stops your opponent from doing literally anything and everything, you may as well surrender, because you\\'re sure as shit not gonna get a chance to play yourself. That\\'s just not fun. I don\\'t play Yu-Gi-Oh! to NOT play it, nor do I play it to deny other people the chance to play it, but there are way too many people who play the game who do. Because \"single-player Duels\" = easy wins/advancement, apparently. Who cares about dignity, am I right?\\n\\nIf you\\'re of a similar mindset to myself, by all means play the game, just don\\'t touch the Ranked, then become quickly bored once you finish all the Solo Mode has to offer because there\\'s nothing else to do in the game. At the time of writing, anyway. I\\'ve heard mention of Events in the future, which if true MAY be enough to draw me back, though I suspect it won\\'t be enough to keep me invested in the long term.\\n\\nIf you\\'re okay with substituting Yu-Gi-Oh! for Solitare, hop right in, enjoy screwing over others like the con man you are, and know that I am judging you [b]very[/b] harshly.\\n\\nIt figures that the only real problem I have with this isn\\'t even Konami\\'s direct fault.\\n\\nEDIT: So Master Duel\\'s first Event came out recently. Honestly, the entire thing is such an excellent summation of Master Duel overall it\\'s not even funny. Excellent concept and well put together (aside from the abundance of connection errors from its first 24 hours, but that got cleared up quick), abundant initial rewards before quickly drying up and drip feeding the rest in the tiniest amounts, and almost entirely let down by the people who play the thing who favour expedient rewards over actually enjoying the damn thing. Though, hilariously, the problem there is the exact reverse of my previous point about the Ranked Mode. Rather than everyone building \"don\\'t let your opponent play\" decks, people are actually playing decks designed to lose as quickly as possible. Which is honestly just a different form of \"don\\'t let your opponent play\" in my eyes.\\n\\nIf this is the standard we\\'re setting for Master Duel Events going forward, my previous prediction was on the money.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ve been playing card games for over 20 years. Gone to tournaments for Netrunner, Magic, Star Wars Destiny - can consider myself a casual try hard - but even with all this experience... I have no idea how YuGiOh works. Given it a shot in the past, and with this latest client thought I\\'d give it another shot. Boy that was a mistake.\\n\\nThe interface isn\\'t bad and it\\'s nice to see the game without all the trappings of the anime smothered all over it. (mobile game) Overall a good experience with teaching a new player the rules. Did most of the solo content and thought, \"Hey, you\\'re winning against the AI easily - let\\'s try playing online.\" Oh yikes... Even at the \"newbie\" level they start you off, people are popping off these crazy combos I\\'ve never seen before. Summoning like 3 monsters, only to sacrifice them and summon 3 more. Or playing hide and seek with a moth guy, or flipping over 3 traps that destroy my board before I get to do anything. What is this game? How does anyone new ever start to play YuGiOh?\\n\\nI get the basics - play some spells, set a trap, summon a monster or tribute it to get a bigger one - but this game is \\'evergreen\\' and there are so many cards with paragraph text abilities and everything starts swirling.\\n\\nPerhaps I\\'m just too old for this shit. Had several \\'Principle\\' Skinner moments playing this game...\\n\\n\"Am I out of touch?\"\\n\\n...\\n\\n\"No, it;s the children who are wrong.\"\\n\\nI\\'d love a mode for use true beginners. Give us a very limited pool of cards to work with to understand the game a bit. Play against other basic decks with one or two tricks before taking on freaking Kaiba or Yugi themselves at the newbie ranks.\\n\\nI know they aren\\'t going to change anything, and I\\'m just an old man yelling at the clouds here, but I wanted to like this game.',\n",

But its still yugioh, and because yugioh is so achetype, immune boss monsters, and handtrap heavy, it is miserable to play without filling your deck with answers like kaijus and nibiru. Everyone is running fustrating hand traps like ash blossum, or even powerful graveyard effects, and if you dont, meta decks will run right over you. Reliable Combo heavy and negate heavy TCGs are not fun, at least not for me. I still enjoy watching others play, as I have been a yugioh fan for many years, but I'm not interested in this game for now\",\n",

Just figure out a archetype you like, craft a card or open one of the structured packs, find that secret pack and throw gems on there.

CHECK THE SETTINGS!\\n\\nBad points:\\n\\n- The game effectively tells your opponent if you have a response to a certain effect or not. An easy way to fix this is to always have this \"wait time\" to create the mind game of having an actual response, but otherwise everyone knows if you have a handtrap on hand.\\n- The solo mode taught me that konami has essentially forgotten about old archetypes. The meta hypes up new archetypes and you get no free cards from them.\\n- You get nothing for losing a 20 minute fight. Come on, throw us a bone. The number of people who would intentionally lose for easy rewards are few and far between, and that can be changed by giving a much better win/lose reward at a higher rank.\\n- Speaking about rank drops, the rate of which you get gems are a little too low.

       "  'review': 'This game is not new player friendly at all, I will assume it was made specifically for people who already play the card game previously.  The tutorials barely help you learn anything other than \"this is how you summon a monster with X deck\" then you play against a person and they end up insta killing you on their first turn (and end up taking 5 mins swapping between monsters). I\\'ll try to document things for other new people like me so you can understand what type difficulties you may face. Oh, and all of the starter decks they give you are absolutely garbage.\\n\\nI found fairly early on that if you are going to tribute summon a monster, and you have done so in error, there is no way to take it back. You are stuck in a bad play, this makes it hard to actually try and discern what stuff does by playing. The terminology used for bringing a monster onto a field is strange to me as well, instead of using something simple like attack and defense, they have decided to use \"Summon\" and \"Set\", with of course no way to fix it immediately after you make the mistake. The elemental cards (currently) do not display any english equivalents for the element of the card, on the cards is a coloured kanji symbol, but when you get to \"choose elements\" it does not display this symbol only uses elements, I hope something like that gets addressed as knowing what your cards do is important. There is no mouseover alt text either for it.\\n\\nThe visibility of what cards on the field are doing is very poor in many cases. I played a bunch of players and the one thing I noticed is that many of them will just attack into that 0-900 card that gets invuln for 2 attacks per turn. If it used some kind of effect similar to the divine shield from hearthstone it would make things more understandable.  Some of the cards will tether to another which is a great thing that lets you know \"hey there is an effect here\" but in place of reading every card that is played it\\'s very lacking with visible information. This comes into effect massively when you are playing and you see the opponent cycling cards for an extended effect, every card is just a description, there is no symbol for many effects that could help with gamer understanding. There is just so much diversity in the game and it is completely overwhelming with a very poor UI. Many times I would read a card for it\\'s effects only for it to basically lie to me and do \"mostly\" the same thing. \\n\\nThere are many abilities that should just \"happen\" but still requires you to activate it. Any example of this is that card that on the turn it is summoned in the battle phase it can double it\\'s attack. If you need the flexibility it seems it should be a toggle off because in most scenarios you want it to be used.\\n\\nThe sections of your table are not really explained at all, what is an extra zone? I found out in one game that there are cards that hit that zone, but there are really no explanation of what it is for until you experiment with it yourself. Deck construction as well does not tell you the requirements of a legal deck, that should be somewhere around when you are making the deck itself. The other thing is when you activate a a card effect (like right driver) you cannot look at your extra deck to match a synchro summons cost.\\n\\nI have played about 15 hours (unlocking more decks for availability) and I have to say I feel I haven\\'t even scratched the surface of complexity. Which I am sure is great for the game longevity, but for me I just want something I can sit down with, play and understand. For the time I would need to invest to understand to convert this into a \"chill game\" is just to much for me. If you know what you are doing already, go for it play a bunch, but for someone with no experience with the anime or the previous card games I can\\'t recommend it in this state.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Pretty fun in low ranks, friend games and solo, but balance is completely broken and game-breaking combos and cards which are rightfully banned in previous games are commonly abused. There is no quick play matchmaking option for more relaxed play, or separate ranked modes for those with different strategies or ideas of how the game should be played.\\n\\nThis means players who wish to have a relaxed and enjoyable time, and who enjoy long back and forth matches, are constantly mixed with those who wish to win at any cost regardless of enjoyment and aim to win in the least amount of turns with the most infallible strategy possible.\\n\\nIf you want an enjoyable experience and aren't someone who exclusively plays to win, then this game is only worth playing with friends or solo, at least until they start banning some of the more game breaking chain summon/infinite combo/deck-out nonsense that forces all players who play online to keep half a deck of hand traps and counters just to have the slightest chance of winning against meta strategies.\\n\\nAll of this means that despite there being over 10,000 different cards in the game to choose from, only a comparatively small number of them are actually viable and most will never see the light of day. The lack of variety tends to become boring quickly, and also takes a lot of the fun out of deck building since almost all decks meant for play will likely end up looking very similar.\\n\\nChances are for most of your time in Master Duel you'll be:\\n\\nA ) Spending 15 minutes plus waiting for the other player to finally end their turn (Due to the endless combos and unnecessarily long turn timers which you'll likely never see run out unless one player has actually fallen asleep) and start actually playing the game, or\\n\\nB ) Hitting the surrender button often just to save time, and taking a penalty while those making the game unplayably slow and boring face no punishment, or\\n\\nC ) You'll give in just and copy a deck and no-brainer strategy from whoever's minmaxed meta deck is currently winning the most games, and further contribute to this game's main problem.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'This is a weird game to review. It\\'s functionally reviewing an entire TCG while also reviewing a game at the same time but I\\'ll give it a try. Also I really wish there was an inbetween recommending and avoiding a game on Steam but I still play this game close to every day so, I do like it still. \\nThe Actual Yu-Gi-Oh part of Master Duel\\nYu-Gi-Oh! is over 20 years old and because of that the game has iterated and evolved since the days of Duel Monsters Era card design and a ton of people who played it as kids might be dissuaded by that but I still do urge people to atleast try to give the TCG a chance when they can even if its casually. The game has shifted away from \"Good Stuff\" piles of decks to archetypes of related cards and away from hyper powerful spells and traps like Pot of Greed and Mirror Force (Not to say there aren\\'t good S&T, just that there isn\\'t as many must include S&Ts) to equally as strong Monster effects and Extra Deck summons. Every couple of years until of recent with the anime detaching itself from the TCG with VRAINS, they\\'ve introduced a new summoning type that pushed the limits of the card design within the game all of which have had their moment in the spotlight.\\n As the speed of the game increased this leads to evolution in the need against dominant strategy, leading to the introduction of Hand Traps (Cards such as Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring, Maxx \"C\", and Infinite Impermanence) and I do think that handtraps overall has made Yu-Gi-Oh much more interesting and interactive than any other card game I\\'ve played, now there\\'s counterplay between both opponents on turn one instead of them just solitairing forever (Not to say that doesn\\'t happen but we\\'ll get to that). Overall, I do very much enjoy how Yu-Gi-Oh! has evolved over it\\'s many years of existence and while it has it\\'s ups and downs, I very much enjoy every era of this game.\\n\\nMaster Duel\\nAfter so many years of unofficial sims ranging from YGOPro to Dueling Network/Book and \"official\" ones such as Legacy of the Duelist which had their own issues. We finally an official simulator that is stated to have continual support and actually plays and looks great. We as players waited excitedly for more news and for the game to come out and when it did it felt like a renaissance for the game as over 200K new players were playing the game on release and for the first week. The game has a honeymoon period, you\\'re given so much as a new player, tens of thousands of gems just given to you to open packs and make decks and it\\'s one of the best things about master duel. You can just build anything you want with the gems given to you and within the first week I was playing full power Pendulum Magicians and Zoodiac like it was 2017-8 all over again. I was climbing the ladder and having the great time seeing all of the different strategies from casual to competitive and it was a blast. Then it kinda just stopped, not to say the game isn\\'t fun anymore but you could feel the game become slower with the gems and people wanting to win so much more. Not to say there\\'s anything wrong with the latter point but the atmosphere was different with Season 2 and beyond.\\n\\nGems and the Economy of Master Duel\\nLike stated before the overall Gems given to you at the start is staggering honestly, you can build essentially anything you want if you\\'re smart with your Gems but after that, the game becomes a lot more stingy with Gems, now after you complete Solo mode and got all of your beginner gems, it is so slow to get over a thousand gems to buy 10 packs, this is aliverated with monthly events which gets a couple thousand if you do everything and they\\'re fun! and I\\'ve built so many decks just being free to play but that\\'s only because I played every event and done most of my dailies every day. Gem prices are also awful, 1 Dollar isn\\'t even enough to buy 1 pack so you can imagine the conversion rate on the rest of price options are bad. So this game is weird where the game gives a lot but only at select times and very much discenstive from spending money on gems.\\n\\nCard Pool and Banlist\\nI think my biggest problem with Master Duel is these two things, the card pool as of the recent update is up to Dawn of Majesty and Synchro Storm but that means the game is behind two core sets in the TCG and almost 4 in the OCG meaning a lot of strategies included in this update like Despia don\\'t even have a good chunk of what makes them good as does Magikey and Suship along with newer decks like HERO and not having Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer. So we have this game in the state of being perpetually behind the modern game which is a major problem especially when the competition in Arena and Pokemon Online both have cards in the game Day 1. \\nBecause of this we also have a metagame that is exactly 1 year behind and a banlist that mostly based around the OCG and by God do i think that is the single thing holding Master Duel back. The OCG and TCG functionally most of the Asia territories versus the rest of the world have had separated banlists for a couple of years now and have distinct differences in changes. The Master Duel banlist is full of some of the most toxic and uninteractive cards of the last couple of years, cards like V.F.D. which lock your monster effects, Rhongomyniad which completely locks summons, full power Drytron with seemingly endless Negates because of EVA and Benten, Simorgh summoning either Apex Avian or a Barrier Statue from deck and protecting it, Union Carrier buster locking you and Halq with O-Lion and Jet making ridiclious boards, just the works.\\nAnd honestly I don\\'t think all of this hurt my enjoyment more than a single card being Maxx \"C\", theres a lot of debate around this card and whether its better at 3 or 0 as a way to curb combo but by god it is the single most overcentralizing card of them all, it is essentially a three of in any deck and anytime I resolve Maxx \"C\" I feel like I always win. The ability to draw every time your opponent special summons is so strong that so many decks also want to play cards that hate out Maxx C or just pass and hope you don\\'t kill them. Maxx \"C\" existence basically kills any handtrap diversity in exchange for essentially only two handtraps either Ash or Maxx C instead of interesting meta calls like D.D. Crow, Ghost Ogre or Veiler. and don\\'t even get me started on trying to break through a board when your opponent Maxx \"C\"s you, essentially refilling their entire hand as you try to playthrough it all and dying on the crackback. I just cannot wait to see something change about the legal cards so the game becomes more healthy at the higher levels of play.\\n\\nMisc Thoughts.\\n\\nMost of my thoughts were above but heres some thoughts about other parts of the game. Solo mode is serviciable, though like a lot of parts of the game theres just a lot of weirdly formatted and translated parts of the text that just make it seem like a robot was telling the stories it almost laughable at times. A lot of the loaner decks are severely underpowered and bricky and are very frustrating to playthrough though the ones that are competently built are super fun to play and get even inspire to try them out on ladder.\\nCustomization could be better but its fine. Summon cut ins are great and add a lot to seeing a lot of old favorites get this cool animation but some feel like missed opportunities to have one like the Egyptian Gods and The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister.\\n\\nClosing Thoughts\\nOverall I do think Yu-Gi-Oh has the potential to be the best sim on the market it just hurdles to go through and I\\'ll continue playing it until becomes that.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Deutsche Übersetzung weiter unten*\\n\\nEN\\n[h1]YU-GI-Oh used to be a really good card game...[/h1]\\nI actually like YU-Gi-Oh and his card game. Collected, swapped and played at school back in the early 2000s. That was THE card game back then. But as the years got older my interests shifted and I quit YU-GI-OH. Also the Playstation games no longer played. But a few years ago, interest resurfaced and I picked up Yu-Gi-Oh! Purchased Legacy of the Duelist. That in itself was a lot of fun for me. However, I never warmed to all the new mechanics. Anything beyond synchro monsters (white cards) is just plain OP and unnecessarily complicated. And it's only getting worse...YU-GI-OH is making life difficult for itself.\\n\\n[h1]Online duels[/h1]\\nFirst the negatives of the game. The worst thing about the game for me and the biggest problem is the multiplayer. As a newcomer or inexperienced player or old-school guy, you just don't stand a chance there. The pendulum, Link and these black cards are so OP that you lost the first turn because the field is full of 3000 ATK monsters, or the opponents can just counter everything. You can only draw and place cards, but not use cards. It doesn't matter whether Monster Effects, Spells or Trap Cards are all negated. The whole meaning and fun factor is lost. But if you ever meet a like-minded duel, the duels are still fun and exciting.\\n\\n[h1]F2P systems can apparently be fair[/h1]\\nWhat I have to give the game high credit for is that you can earn all the cards without real money. You can buy boosters for crystals, which you can get a thousand times for free, but you can also buy a specific card directly. You can melt duplicate cards and get points for which you can then buy a new card. 3 for 1\\nThe only question is whether you always get that many crystals for free. Because if not, tickets are really expensive. 1x Bosster for €2, or 10 boosters for €29...it's really not cheap. I would rather buy physical cards^^\\n\\n[h1]Single Player[/h1]\\nThere's even a single payer and story mode. You should actually learn all the functions, but you don't. Actually you only do what the game asks you to do without thinking about it or understanding it^^ Since all cards have different effects and others work, that doesn't help much^^ The cards are often complicated, long and incomprehensibly described. Real duels are fun. The AI \\u200b\\u200bisn't as dumb as other Yu-Gi-Oh games.\\n\\n[h1]hopes and wishes[/h1]\\nI would really appreciate an old school mode and fair matchmaking.\\nPlus an Unrank mode. I quit the game angry after the 5th link opponent because it was the 3rd fight in a row where everything was countered by me...I don't want that. Wants to play everything up to synchro monsters and nothing more. I also wish that the F2P system remains fair. And if the prices were a lot cheaper, I would also leave one or two euros there.\\n\\nDE\\n[h1]YU-GI-Oh war einmal ein wirklich gutes Kartenspiel...[/h1]\\nEigentlich mag ich YU-Gi-Oh und sein Kartenspiel. Schon damals Anfang der 2000er in der Schule gesammelt, getauscht und  gespielt. Das war damals DAS Kartenspiel. Aber im laufe der Jahre, in den mal älter wurde haben sich die Interessen verschoben und ich habe aufgehört mit YU-GI-OH. Auch die Playstation Spiele nicht mehr gezockt. Aber vor ein paar Jahren kam die Interesse wieder auf und ich habe mir Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist gekauft. Das hat mir auch an sich viel Spaß bereitet. Allerdings wurde ich mit den ganzen neuen Mechaniken nie warm. Alles über Synchro-Monster (weiße Karten) hinaus ist einfach nur OP und unnötig kompliziert. Und es wird immer schlimmer...YU-GI-OH macht sich damit selbst das Leben schwer.\\n\\n[h1]Online Duelle[/h1]\\nErst einmal das Negative an dem Spiel. Das für mich schlimmste an den Spiel und das größte Problem ist der der Multiplayer. Als Neuling oder unerfahrener Spieler bzw. Old-School-Typ hat man dort einfach keine Chance. Die Pendel, Link und diese schwarzen Karten sind so OP das man in der ersten Runde verloren hat weil das feld voller 3000 ATK Monster liegt, oder die Gegner können einfach alles kontern. Du kannst quasi nur Karten ziehen und Karten legen, aber keine Karten verwenden. Egal ob Monster Effekte, Zauber- so wie Fallen- Karten werden alle annulliert. Da geht halt der komplette Sinn und Spaßfaktor verloren. Aber wenn du mal auf einen Gleichgesinnten triffst, sind die Duelle nach wie vor Spaßig und aufregend.\\n\\n[h1]F2P Systeme können anscheinend fair sein[/h1]\\nWas ich dem Spiel hoch anrechnen muss ist dass man sich alle Karten ohne Echtgeld erspielen kann. Du kannst dir Booster für Kristalle kaufen, die man Tausendfach kostenlos bekommt, aber auch direkt eine bestimmte Karte. Du kannst doppelte Karten einschmelzen und erhälst dafür Punkte für die du dann eine neue Karten kaufen kannst. 3 für 1. \\nDie Farge ist nur ob man immer so viele Kristalle gratis bekommt. Denn wenn nicht sind Karten echt teuer. 1x Bosster für 2€, oder 10 Booster für 29€...Ist halt echt nicht günstig. Da würde ich mir lieber physische Karten kaufen^^\\n\\n[h1]Singleplayer[/h1]\\nEs gibt sogar einen Singlepayer und einen Story Modus. Da sollte man eigentlich alle Funktionen erlehnen aber, das tut man nicht. Eigentlich tut man nur das was Spiel von einem verlangt ohne darüber nachzudenken oder zu verstehen^^ Da alle karten andere Effekte haben und andere funktionieren bringt das auch nicht sonderlich viel^^ Die Karten sind oft kompliziert lang und unverständlich beschrieben. Allerdings sind die Freien Duelle spaßig. Die KI ist nicht so dumm wie anderen Yu-Gi-Oh spielen.\\n\\n[h1]Hoffnungen und Wünsche[/h1]\\nEin Old-School Modus und ein Faires Matchmaking würde ich doch stark begrüßen.\\nZu dem ein Unrank-Modus. Ich habe 5 Rank Spiele gespielt und nur eins gewonnen. Ich hab beim 5x Link Gegner das Spiel vor Wut beendet, weil es der dritte Kampf in Folge war, wo einfach alles von mir gekontert wurde...Auf sowas habe ich keine Lust. Will alles bis Synchro-Monster spielen und mehr nicht. Zudem wünsche ich mir das, das F2P System fair bleibt. Und wenn die Preise um einiges günstiger wären, würde ich auch den ein oder anderen Euro da lassen.\\n\\n\\nMöchtest du mehr Meinungen von mir lesen?

You can trade in cards you don't want to buy a specific one of the same rarity you want at a 3:1 rate, buying an Ultra Rare will get you a free roll on its pack so you can roll for the rest of the archetype, and if your tenroll doesn't drop a UR you'll be guaranteed one on your next one. The tutorial's skippable for fast rerolls, there's no dailies besides starting up the game, no paywall, and the game just vomits gems at you. The most offensive thing I've seen is that archetype packs only unlock for 24 hours after getting an SR or UR from them, but that gets refreshed whenever you get a card from them.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I really want to give this a positive review. It\\'s so close to being great.\\n\\nMy first impressions were stellar; the game is functional and polished, with excellent onboarding and a decent chunk of solo content that does a good job of teaching you how to use the various archetypes. It also hit just the right amount of generosity; I felt like I was earning enough gems to gradually build up a couple of decks -- not enough to instantly assemble a tuned list, but enough to make decent progress a little bit at a time. The clever design of the secret packs allows you to target farm specific cards and archetypes, which is most welcome in a game with such a huge card pool. Matchmaking is lightning quick and it feels like I\\'m generally paired with players of similar skill.\\n\\nThen the onboarding ended.\\n\\nWhat had felt like a reasonable earning pace was in fact just the starter kit. Once you\\'ve used it up, the free-to-play progress vanishes entirely; you can, maybe, earn a single pack for every twenty games won. I actually wouldn\\'t have minded spending a decent chunk of money, because I was having a lot of fun, but the real money shop prices are offensively high -- more than five times what I\\'d have been willing to pay for the products on offer. Exacerbating this issue is the crafting system, which only allows you to trade in cards for others of the same rarity (no trading up, in other words), plus the fact that every tech card and boss monster is in the \"ultra rare\" slot.\\n\\nThe end result of this is that while the first deck you build is essentially free, the others will probably run you between $100 and $300 apiece. As someone who prefers to experiment with ideas rather than copying lists from other players, this pushes the game well outside of my price range. Once I\\'ve grown tired of the first deck I built, I\\'ll probably stop playing for good.\\n\\nAll this game needs to get a hard recommend from me is for the gem shop prices to come way, way down (more than half) and the passive gem progression rate from games to go way, way up (more than 5x). I would gladly have dropped $60 on this game if I felt like I was getting good value, but as it is now it seems to be a pretty egregious ripoff.',\n",

       "  'review': \"(Disclaimer: I've kept my eye on Yu-Gi-Oh as a game for a while, I planned to return to it last year, but then a certain event got worse in my country.)\\n\\nFor a F2P card game, from Konami of all companies, it is surprisingly generous. You can make a meta deck just with the first 10k gems and small amounts of luck/crafting. The downside to that, however, is that people who know the game will demolish the lower ranks until they normalize due to the huge power imbalance that exists between casual and meta decks in Yu-Gi-Oh! 'Old-School' Yu-Gi-Oh! this is not.\\n\\nI often found myself surrendering due to my deck (Stardust/Synchrons) often having no outs for likes of Shaddolls and the like, which sucks, because I like the aesthetic, not to say I wouldn't play meta if I could win more, but I prefer to work out a deck on my own, rather than base off lists people have made. As a game, I feel this also is just due to MASSIVE amount of cards/effects that there are, the game can feel really daunting, which may lead to an inevitable loss of player-base in the future, ala arena shooters.\\n\\nThe banlist is a weird amalgamation of OCG and TCG, so Maxx 'C' is on 3 and Red-Eyes Dragoon is Forbidden. The menus feel a bit sluggish in general, as well, probably due to it being always online. Card text can be a pain to read mid-combo, if you're returning and I feel some QoL would work for this game, like it being more consistent in being able to read what a revealed card is in an opponents hand.\\n\\nOverall, I have no clue if I'd recommend it, honestly. On one hand, it is a Yu-Gi-Oh! simulator that is surprisingly good, despite some strange design decisions, on the other, you will get smacked around if you don't really play in a serious fashion or off-meta, at least at launch, it may change as things normalize.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1] This is the ULTIMATE Yu-Gi-Oh! Game! [/h1]\\n\\nAs someone who has been playing YGO since the start with the TCG and then spent many, many hours over the past few years on Duel Links, I am so glad that a proper YGO game has been released with the normal, non speed-duel format that Duel Links has.\\n\\nThis game has a great solo mode that allows new players to figure out the rules, and even players like me who are not up to scratch to learn the latest Archetypes and stuff like Link summoning.\\n\\nOne thing that stood out to me is how it BOMBARDS you with free gems and rewards, just by logging on and completing a few basic missions the game will give you thousands of gems, which is enough to buy each of the 3 bundles, 3 copies of EACH of the 3 structure decks currently available, and thousands more to buy over 120 packs of your choosing.\\n\\nThis game features a crafting system similar to Hearthstone's dust system, you can scrap spare cards to get currency of the same rarity, which allows you to craft any card you want. Thanks to this dust system and the amount of gems you receive, I already managed to complete a full Ancient Gears deck which has already taken me to Platinum rank.\\n\\nThe solo mode rewards you with limited cards like Raigeki, Monster Reborn and such, which I feel is a nice touch. You can also earn more structure decks through the solo mode.\\n\\nOverall I have to say that if you love YGO or are a newcomer to the series, give this game a try as you will find it fair, fun and fluid. You can easily build the deck that you desire.\\n\\n10/10.\",\n",

There is no \"Skill\" to this game when a 100% get your shit out strat exists. Yes, you literally can make decks that can get 100% your entire strat out, I\\'m not kidding this is how brutally bad this game has gotten. \\n\\nI was recommended by a friend to come back to Yu-Gi-oh and most of my game time wasn\\'t of me playing, after playing for a while I spend 3-5 hours reading through all cards to get a good understanding of the new ideas of this game since I quit after XYZ. Holy hell, how did we get this bad with the meta. Don\\'t even think about using a spell card to clear the board, if you\\'re not going first you\\'re not playing if you\\'re against a meta slave. \\n\\nI\\'m always arguing game knowledge varies from game to game. Let\\'s be real in the heat of the moment no one thinks at 100% mental capacity much-less remember every option possible, but Yu-Gi-oh now a days is just watching my opponent play PBE, if you\\'re not a meta slave to the most OP negate deck. Also not going first, you\\'re not playing. I don\\'t even want to mention the op decks since I don\\'t want to promote this toxic way of gaming. Just to give you can idea, you can summon a monster that literally will force your opponents monsters that they summon to always be set face-down defence mode. This strat will always have a negate in it preventing you from doing fuck all(No I\\'m not talking about Ash P, it\\'s not a good negate card since it\\'s a one time thing only. Trust me negates from certain cards can be used infinity).\\n\\nWhen my friend showed me his insane op deck, he literally said to me. You don\\'t need to know what all 10k Cards do, just know what negate card you want to use and deck for them you want to build. It\\'s easy to get your monster to over 8k dmg, after checking out the insane effects we have no adays. I only thought \"yeah, I could do that easily back in the day with the right cards in hand\". But now it\\'s like I might as well pull the card out of thin air with all the effects that can bring shit to my hand constantly.\\n\\nLet\\'s say you didn\\'t run into a meta slave and a person that is just playing for fun, too bad. That player will most likely spam monster\\'s that can be revived by it\\'s own passive or another monsters passive in their GY. You can still have back and forth duels, but it will not happen that often. \\n\\nUnless you just love Yu-Gi-oh for some reason. Please don\\'t play this, promote better games please.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Now, this glorified strategy game has downgraded to the point where the majority of players spend 20 minutes drawing half their deck and beating you on the first/second turn. You could hardly call this fun.\\n\\nEven though ranked matches aren't fun, solo play is okay and you get a generous amount of resources early game. You should be able to build several decks after completing several solo missions.

Plus they need to reduce the amount of Real money to buy Gems from them because the price they are asking now is to much\\n\\n(2) some decks are just unbearable to play against due to the amount of Negates (literally faced a dude who went first and set up his entire board that negated any spell or trap card i would put down and negated any monster effect i could possibly use to the point it was useless to do ANYTHING. even had a monster effect).\\n\\n(3) Konami needs to add more ways to earn UR points into the game because its hard to make any decks when you dont have any UR's to make some of them. \\n\\n(4) A Updated Ban list would be great Cause i can name over 2 dozen cards that either need to be banned or limited (mostly Limited)\\n\\n(5) add a Casual mode to the game and not just having Ranked mode would be nice. Maybe tag team 2v2? would be cool.\\n\\n(6) this may be a Hot take but maybe adding a Chat system would be good? that way you can talk to people online in the game about how to do certain decks or how to play them to get better.\\n\\n(7) Reduce the time when its your turn. I hate playing with people who take like 7 minutes to do things. please reduce the timer.\\n\\n pretty much my POV of the games state right now. These are my Opinion on the matter but hopefully some of the problems i listed can be addressed and soon.\\n \\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'The following review is from the perspective of someone already acquainted with the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter years of games like Legacy of the Duelist and Duel Links whose target demographic seemed to be chiefly anime fans, and unlike LotD, which quickly dropped updates, Master Duel seems to be shaping up to be a solid introduction to the TCG, and a competitor to other virtual card games like Hearthstone and MTG: Arena.\\n\\nMy first impressions of the monetization system, the part I was most worried about when Master Duel was announced, are very positive. The crafting system seems to be leagues more generous than its contemporaries.\\n\\nThe in game currency, Gems, can be easily obtained en masse by new players, and I\\'ve talked to a lot of TCG players that seemed shocked at how easy they found it to assemble a deck that would be viable at the highest level of play without paying any money.\\n\\n\\nOne of the release packs, \"Master Pack\", has 6750 cards in it. Unlike a lot of other card games, such as Magic: The Gathering, YGO has no set rotation-- cards from 20+ years ago are still legal for competitve play. In 2021, the game exceeded 10,000 different cards printed.\\n\\nIn order to assist players to build coherent decks, there seem to be a handful of structures in place:\\n\\n- Structure Decks can be purchased to have an out-of-the-box playable deck, and up to 3 may be purchased in order to give players more copies of the cards they\\'d like to use.\\n\\n- When certain cards are obtained, something called a \\'special pack\\' is unlocked for the next 24 hours. While the pool of cards these packs draw from are the same as the \\'Master Pack\\', 4 of the 8 cards are guaranteed to be tied to a \"theme\", making assembling full sets of archetypes of cards significantly easier.\\n\\n- Solo Mode is a single player experience that rewards the player with gems, decks, and powerful cards such as Monster Reborn for free.\\n\\n- The crafting system is very generous. Cards can be deconstructed and used to craft cards of the same rarity, and these crafting materials are also given out for completing small tasks called \\'missions\\'.\\n\\n- Bundles that give discounted packs in addition to powerful generic cards such as \"Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring\" are also in the shop.\\n\\n\\nI believe YGO has enjoyed success in the last decade in no small part due to the accessibility of the game via online fan simulators such as Dueling Book and EDOPRO. Konami not only had to compete with their contemporaries, but they also needed to compete with massively popular fan projects that have had years of polish.\\n\\nThe result is an officially supported YGO simulator that\\'s incredibly easy to play without paying money.\\n\\n\\nThe OST is also notably good, which fans of the anime, Duel Links, or Tag Force games have come to expect. The in-game UI is simple and easy to use, as well.\\n\\nI do still have some minor gripes, however.\\n\\n- While the tutorial is skippable, and you still obtain full rewards for doing so, a few other duels in Solo Mode follow a tutorial-like structure. Dismissing prompts in these \\'practice\\' events are sluggish, and I often found myself putting off completing these events for their rewards simply because I found waiting for them to finish annoying.\\n\\n- While there\\'s no issues with the card text, some of the UI prompts for non-Duel related things, such as the tutorial, or Solo Mode cutscenes seem to either be machine translated, or translated by someone not fluent in English, leaving stiff, jarring wording.\\n\\nOverall, however, my experience so far with Master Duel has been great. It\\'s blown all my expectations out of the water. It wasn\\'t too long ago a lot of seasoned YGO players were expressing caution about its monetization before we had much information. \\n\\nWhile I was more optimistic in this regard, I was still absolutely blown away at how easy I\\'m finding it to assemble the cards to build top-tier decks. I\\'m looking forward to seeing how Konami plans to support Master Duel in the future.',\n",

I'm pretty sure an opponent took over 5 minutes to play what felt like an extremely endless stream of cards. I can't speak for the balance of the game but it's rather silly to have to move the game to my other monitor and do something else while I wait for my turn, I may as well be playing via E-mail.\\n\\nI don't think that problem is exclusive to this version of course, just of Yu-Gi-Oh! as a whole and it's very faithful in that regard but that doesn't mean that's fun to sit through.\\n\\nUltimately the game is free so absolutely give it a go and form your own opinion but I found myself losing interest very quickly as I alt-tabbed and waited for my opponent to finish their 27 card combo.\",\n",

Either that, or they will inflict enough effect damage and beat you without giving you a single turn. Don't forget Exodia decks who will keep drawing cards and basically keep you hostage for 15 minutes until they pull all cards they need for Exodia kill. If you lose coinflip and play second without handtraps, you lose 90% of the time. What's even worse, it's that a single handtrap is often not enough to stop your opponent's combo.\\n\\nYou can not play this game casually. If you played Yu-Gi-Oh in the past and wanted to check how it's like today, remember that we live in the era of internet where everyone has access to toxic decks that prevent your opponent from even placing a single card. You can always look up an invincible deck yourself, but then again where's the enjoyment in copying someone else? You can only have fun by playing with friends, but basically everything else is more fun when you do it with friends, so just go and do anything else except playing this toxic, bot ridden time waster.\\n\\nPS.

Back in the days, the game lasts quite long, and is less luck-dependent than now in my opinion.\\n* It is not a duel anymore. It is more \"you vs you\", than \"you vs someone else\". It is less interactive especially when you see someone spending half of their time trying to do different combinations on their own. \\n* It is not much balanced. I know that there are much more combinations and things to do now, but I guess that you just need to make two or three strong decks from the internet, and get used to them, and that\\'s it.\\n* I have never encountered the abbreviation OTK in a card game before until I played this game. (OTK stands for One Turn Kill). I won\\'t even comment on this!\\nAnyway, back in the days, summoning an 8-star monster was the apex of the match. Now, with those new kinds of summoning, it is a normal thing to have three 8-star monsters sitting around next to each other with very strong effects. Sorry not sorry.',\n",

       "  'review': \"The problems with Master Duel are the same problems plaguing Yugioh for years. Other reviews are not exaggerating when they say opponents will take 10 minutes to complete their turns and then OTK you with a field full of overpowered monsters. That is the state of the metagame, it's been that way for a decade now. And it's not fun. It's not a matter of skill or being good, it's a matter of not being fun. I don't want to spend 10 minutes watching my opponent make their moves. And yeah, I can watch a YouTube video while they do, but can I really say I'm enjoying the game, either Master Duel or the Yugioh card game? \\n\\nAnd of course, it's the myriad meta strategies you know and hate. Chains and chains of summons, usually Links but sometimes Xyz (especially if Zoodiacs are involved). Ash Blossom to interrupt and halt critical combos. Utopia OTKs. Exodia OTKs. Cards that shut down almost all forms of counterplay or punish the opponent for removing them. Had an opponent the other day that comboed Heroic Champion Rhongomyniad with Barian Hope to gain Rhongomyniad's effect to entirely lock down my ability to do almost anything without any cost or drawback, and there was nothing in my opening hand to stop it so I lost in two turns. Sound like fun?\\n\\nI remember how in Yugioh Arc-V, Zarc played a deck centered on shutting down his opponents by negating or nullifying their plays and summoning ridiculously overpowered monsters that were nearly impossible to get rid of, and the protagonists called him out as a coward who wouldn't let opponents fight back because he was afraid of losing. It's sadly ironic that a lot of metadecks in Yugioh these days play exactly as Zarc did, and just like Zarc they will overwhelm you and beat you in one or two turns without effort.\\n\\nOn the occasion I get matched with an opponent with a deck of power level equivalent to mine and skill level as well, and we have a good back-and-forth duel where turns take a few minutes but not 10 minutes, and I need to stay on my toes to keep up with them but don't feel overwhelmed. Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose, but either way I usually have fun. I like duels like that, but they're rare. There's a way to tag yourself as a Casual duelist in your profile, but there's only one matchmaking queue, no way to seek out other Casual players for games.\\n\\nIt's dumb that you get no rewards if you surrender. I've lost, I know it, my opponent knows it, why must I wait 5 minutes for them to finish flexing on how good their deck is before they attack and finish me off? You get rewards if you lose, so why not if you surrender when you've clearly lost? I also regret that there's no in-game chat. I definitely know there's potential for abuse, but being able to talk to opponents, even if it was restricted to after a game, would be nice. There's times I'm genuinely impressed by opponents' creativity, or I just want to wish them good game and compliment their playing, but nope. I also wish there would be a chance to challenge an opponent to a rematch, or to look for a Best of Three opponent instead of single rounds.\\n\\nI liked the idea of the Xyz Event, but it was flawed in practice since a lot of players ran decks that don't rely on Xyz, including Pendulum, Monarchs, and any other number of Main Deck archetypes. I know it's not feasible to enforce players to play Xyz archetypes, but it still hurt the idea that that was what the events was supposed to be about. \\n\\nI also like the Solo mode, brief backstories of card lore and opportunities to play AI opponent and try out new strategies and decks. I think an AI versus mode would be a good idea, give an AI opponent a specific kind of deck you want to face and play against it. Would also allow you to practice against meta archetypes for ranked play.\\n\\nThe Yugioh card game itself has the same problems as always: decks that are too fast and take several minutes to do a single turn and a duel will only last three turns or so before one player is overwhelmed. Master Duel will live or die depending on how it allows players to play the game iwthout having to the same OTK metadecks over and over. And there is potential for that to happen - different matchmaking queues for players seeking different kinds of duels, more events to encourage usage of more diverse deck types, allow for more socialization between players. As-is for now, you're entering queues hoping you get matched against an opponent that will be fun, and sometimes you do, sometimes you don't. It's down to the luck of the draw.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'As an old Yugioh player when I heard about this I was pretty hyped and kept an eye out for news regularly, so when it did the surprise release I was excited to jump in right away. I do think the game is worth trying at the very least if you have any interest in Yugioh or trading card games, but it may not be for you long term or at all. I\\'ve got things I liked and dislike about the game, but it did *just* release so any of these could change in time.\\n\\nPros:\\n-Tons of cards to obtain so you could make all your favorite decks from the past\\n-The economy seems good at the moment, everything in the store is bought with the in game currency, which if you don\\'t want to grind you can buy gems to speed things up\\n-Because of the decent economy you can easily get enough packs and craft cards to have either a strong deck asap\\n-The music, while repetitive at times, is actually really good imo\\n-So far I\\'ve had no bugs or game breaking errors occur\\n-Solo mode is interesting, you get a brief story related to the lore of different groups of monsters, then use them a bit to eventually unlock a deck to start building around them\\n\\nCons\\n-The game pass which is another way to unlock rewards outside of achievements requires you to go into ranked, and if you were just looking for a casual jump into your past when you downloaded this you will likely lose to some deck on their turn 1 after they spend the full 480 second timer they get each turn summoning and activating what feels like their entire deck\\n-Deck editor doesn\\'t seem to have a way to search by card text, like if I want to find all my cards that help me draw a search feature where I can type in \"draw\" and see any card with that text in it would be nice (if this is already in the game it is not apparent or easy to find)\\n-If your opponent is going through a combo quickly and you\\'re trying to read up on cards you\\'ve never seen you\\'ll constantly be interrupted by the next card/effect\\n-The last con is more of a con of the card game itself rather than just this video game, Yugioh when it first came out still felt like a slower game despite the fact it wasn\\'t reliant on resources like Magic The Gathering\\'s lands or Pokemon\\'s energy cards, but now the game has been around so long and with almost every card ever made allowed, minus cards on the banned list, the game has become something where its difficult to play what you\\'d like to play because of the power creep\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed what I\\'ve played so far, but I feel like because of what Yugioh has become as a game, without some change this won\\'t keep me long term. Would very much like to see some things implemented to spice things up, from different formats so not everything is available and cards within that format feel balanced against each other, a tag duel feature would also be nice, the one where you share a board with your teammate but alternate turns using your own decks and hands. You may feel the same about some of my points, and others entirely different, so give it a try, the game is free, where you go from there is up to you.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Well I launched the Game, bought like 10 Packs, made my first Deck, looked up for a game at \"ROOKIE RANK 2\" and got OTKed by TCG Netdecks. Great Game... and I still got ranked up afterwards, lol. If you are new at any card game, you should not face complete Meta or Rogue Decks at the start. In Duel Links it\\'s also not the case, not even in Hearthstone.\\n\\nAnd of course it has to be a gotcha game. The ingame Shop is kinda... idk. You have \"Master Packs\" which you need to buy to unlock more specific packs (for example a Pendelum Magician or Blackwing Pack if you open such cards) which will be there for only 24h. So the game automatically wants to spend you more currency very fast. Yes, at the beginning you will have A LOT of ingame currency which kinda let you made every Deck when starting the game. BUT.. It\\'s a gotcha game and considering the real life currency prices you need to pay for ingame currency compared to how much ingame currency you\\'ll get at the start, I think the game will get very expensive after you play a while. Also I gotta say the crafting system is great. You can dismantle every card, you can craft every card. It\\'s that what Duel Links needed the whole time to be perfect.\\n\\nAlso the game runs very bad. I don\\'t know the recommandations. But my Computer should handle it. And the game tells me all the time I have a bad connection, which is simply not true. But it\\'s release day, so might be fixed later. \\n\\nBut please Konami:\\n\\n- Make a mode for beginners\\n- Make a better tutorial (That Tutroial doesn\\'t explain the Game at all)\\n- Make faster game modes. Playing a pvp Duel takes forever. \\nOn my first game with my Noob Deck I faced a Shadoll Deck. It should be clear that I have no chance by playing a \"somewhat\" Beatdown Deck against comptitive Shadolls. And still.. The game took like 30mins to play (I was not sure if I\\'ll get anything if I concede), simply because the plays take so long to do. \\n- Make different game modes (There are many Yugioh Fanboys out there, but when it comes to current TCG, there is only a minority really playing it), maybe like Goat Format or Draft Modes.\\n\\nHearthstone and Duel Links had such a success because they are fast games. A Game takes like 5-10mins, it\\'s interactive with smooth Animations. Master Duels however feels clunky, too many clicks, too many interruptions. Konami should adress that somehow. Make the game more accessible. Because if they can\\'t get the casual Fanbase into the game, then I doubt Master Duels will be as successful as Duel Links (which I doubt already to be honest). Which is sad, because I really want to be Master Duels a great game. \\n\\nBut as far as now, I would not recommend it. I simply don\\'t see any point yet why not playing stuff like Dueling book or YGOPro over Master Duels except you might be a competitive player wanting to join tournaments and stuff.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Coming from a guy who has had an on-again-off-again relationship with Yu-Gi-Oh! for 19 years, I\\'m really enjoying what I\\'ve seen so far.\\n\\nThis is a solid YGO online duel platform delivered in the form of a free-to-play digital collectable card game. The polish is incredible for a game of this nature. Menus, cards, animations, the whole package is just stunning visually for a series known for rather bland presentations in their digital games (aside from a few of the DS and PSP titles, at least in my opinion). Also, the soundtrack goes harder than most AAA games released today for zero logical reason whatsoever. It\\'s FANTASTIC.\\n\\nThe economy seems to be fairly generous at this point. The game features several thousand cards and most of today\\'s most popular decks can be built in their entirety from the card pool available. You earn gems (the game\\'s freemium currency) at a very rapid pace initially, but it will dry up pretty soon if you don\\'t start participating in the Ranked Duels against other players. That said, you should have enough off the bat to purchase the premium \"battle pass\" called Duel Pass Gold, as well as one each of three decently priced bundles that include 10 boosters at a discount on top of a copy of an Ultra Rare staple (Ash Blossom, Solemn Warning, and Lightning Storm). Buy these ASAP. You can use the remaining gems on cosmetics, two structure decks (imo, these are only worth your time if they include cards for a deck you want to build ASAP; the two structure decks are themed around Odd-Eyes Pendulum Magicians and DZW Utopia decks), or boosters. Boosters come in a few different varieties: Master Packs which pull from basically the entire card pool of the game, Selection Packs that feature a much smaller pool of cards (the two currently available feature a pool of decent staples in one pack with no real overarching theme while the other pack is purely nostalgia bait with all the Blue-Eyes, Dark Magicians, and other various anime Ace Monsters), Legacy Packs which are small 2-card packs that pull from their own pool of mostly older cards (these are not purchasable but are earned through gameplay), and finally Secret Packs. Secret Packs are where you should get the most value for your gems when pursuing the cards for a particular archetype. These packs are unlocked for 24 hours once you obtain a Super Rare (SR) or Ultra Rare (UR) card that the pack in question \"features\". For example, if you craft or open a Traptrix Sera, you will unlock the Secret Pack \"Mother Nature\\'s Snare\". Then you can focus your gems into opening these Secret Packs for improved odds of pulling cards specific to the archetype you\\'re gunning for (in my example, these packs will feature more Traptrix cards and some of their supporting cards). Whereas Master Packs pull 8 cards from the total pool available, Secret Packs instead pull 4 cards from the Master Pack pool then pull another 4 cards from the \"featured\" pool of that pack. This system is great, in my opinion, by helping to reduce the variability of collecting by a decent degree while players strive to obtain specific decks.\\n\\nAs for targeting specific cards to fill in the gaps where your openings may have failed you, there is a crafting system in the game as well. Each rarity of card has a currency of crafting materials (N - Normal, R - Rare, SR - Super Rare, and UR - Ultra Rare). Crafting any card costs 30 currency of the rarity of that card. You can earn this currency through gameplay rewards, mission rewards, and by dismantling other cards (only cards you obtained through opening boosters). Cards dismantle at a rate of 10 CP for a normal copy, 15 CP for a \"glossy\" copy, and a full 30 CP for a \"royal\" prismatic copy. Given these rates, you can effectively trade any 3 cards for any 1 other card given they are all the same rarity (2 glossies for 1 non-glossy and a straight 1-for-1 for a royal to a specific non-glossy of your choice). This is an extremely fair system in my opinion compared to similar digital CCGs on the market who either have a system that pays way too low for the cards that are dismantled in crafting materials (Hearthstone) or have a crafting system centered entirely around more packs with no ability to convert your collection into more desirable cards (Magic Arena).\\n\\nGiven these tips and the amount of gems the game throws at you early on, you should be capable of building at least one strong deck right off the bat while also picking up a handful of staples for later decks in the process. Now I can\\'t say how the gem economy will hold up once the launch period is over and gems are harder to come by, but given how generous the current crafting system is, I think it should be okay going forward.\\n\\nI\\'m also a big fan of cross-platform availability. Being able to stop playing in the PC room, stand up, go sit on my much more comfortable couch, play some more on my Xbox Series S, head to the bedroom, and play just a bit more on my Switch before I get some shuteye has been pretty awesome these past couple of nights when I got home from work. The Switch port seems a little laggy at times, but it\\'s been great on PC and Xbox and I imagine they\\'ll continue to smooth out the hitches as they go on Switch.\\n\\nFinally, the gameplay. There\\'s 3 primary modes of play: Ranked Duel, Duel Room (basically rooms people can join and play matches with each other over and over instead of dealing with a ranked randomized queue), and Solo Mode. Ranked Duel is exactly as it sounds, matchmaking-queue-based duels with other players from any platform. Winner gets a bunch of Duel Pass points and increased rewards at the end of the game, loser gets less Duel Pass points and less rewards (provided they don\\'t surrender, which forfeits the rewards and Duel Pass progress). As the game is still brand new, the low ranks are still filled with players of all types, including meta players, so newer players may feel lost or just discouraged at the moment. For those players, I would suggest sticking to duel rooms with other similar players found online or trying out the game\\'s Solo Mode while the meta players climb the ranks and clear the lower ranks for the newer or returning players to the franchise. The Solo Mode is essentially a bunch of scenarios where you learn about some of the lore of certain archetypes in the game, as well as learn how to play them on a rudimentary level through practice and loaner deck duels against the AI. You can also try your own deck against these same AI for further rewards, such as cards, gems, cosmetics, and even sometimes entirely new structure decks! I\\'m spending a lot more time in Solo right now than against players for the exact reasons listed above, but I am keen to finally play some PVP once the ladder settles a bit from the launch.\\n\\nOnly other thing I haven\\'t really touched on is Duel Live which allows you to watch a (random?) replay of a duel for some very miniscule daily rewards. Take it or leave it for now, lol, however I\\'m being led to understand that Duel Live will allow for people to watch tournament duels in game in the future. Keep an eye out, I guess.\\n\\nThat\\'s pretty much it. All in all, I do believe this is the definitive official experience a lot of us YGO fans have been waiting on. There\\'s something here for everyone, including old hats at the game wanting to come back and have a little fun with their old cards against friends in the Duel Rooms. Definitely give it a try if you have even a passing interest in Yu-Gi-Oh! these days.',\n",

       "  'review': 'It is a free game so you don\\'t have to spend any real money to play it. You are able to do off line stuff however they are pretty limiting and not the main purpose for this game as they are there to help you learn how to play while giving you some candy for learning. The main feature is the online play, real players in real time fighting with their own decks. Sounds sweet and they have almost every card available for you to make whatever deck you want!\\n\\nPros: Lots of cards and you can create your deck. At the start they do give you a somewhat of a fighting chance by allowing you to pick three main decks to use (you can buy the others later on if you changed your mind) with being a normal dragon blue eyes deck, a pendulum deck, and a link deck. You can buy packs to earn more cards so you can edit these decks or create a new one. They do give you new missions each day so you can earn some in game money to buy more packs, mats, icons, ect. The missions are not too hard as some are just play rank three times to get the reward while other missions stack so if you do part one of destroying your opponent monsters then you can do part two if you want to destroy more (they do stack so you don\\'t need to accept the reward on the first one before doing the 2nd part). With the in game money you can change your view of the board so it looks interesting or different. They did worked hard to make it more interactive and enjoyable.\\n\\nCons: Not sure if it is the player or the servers but the player does take more time then needed to make a move. So if you are dueling and someone wants to waste your time by sitting at their desk doing nothing for 400 sec(top wait is 500 sec) each of their turn then be ready to turn on some tv or movie while you wait. Right now there is only Rank dealing so you battle people within your rank. Why is this bad instead of good? Because of the Pay to Win system they added to this free game. A new player can throw down 100 dollars or more to get a lot of good cards. Luckily once they win enough then you don\\'t have to deal with them as much but they can be on your tail for three to five games depending on how many have done it and how many points they score affecting their rank. But because pay to win is enabled in this game I can\\'t imagine the ranks further ahead are going to be \"fun\" if you are playing this for free. Another thing is the packs. Each pack has over 6k cards in it. So if you are looking to build a certain deck and know which pack to get then good luck getting those cards with the odds. Basically you are trying to get 40 cards with may 15 added with a pack that has 6750 cards in it. Oh and a bonus, one pack may not have all the cards you need and you can get secret packs unlocked that will last for a day before you have to find them all over again. So you are not just grinding for one pack with over 6k cards but another pack that is limited for another 6k cards clogging the changes.\\n\\nWith this it is free and you can play it, no harm. But I don\\'t recommend this because of the long run in this game. You do have to spend either a lot of time grinding or a lot of real money in hopes you get the cards you want or need to move foward. Yu-Gi-Oh with ranked matches only is too meta for a lot of players and because of this you do need to get a tier 0 or tier 1 deck as soon as possible to rank up to the top and get more rewards.\\n\\nEdit: I noticed later on as I played more and explored the game features that you can create cards with rarity tokens you can earn, grind, or create. Each card, depending on its rarity, only requires 30 tokens to create so if you want three copies of that one card you\\'ll need 90 tokens of that rarity. With this in mind you cannot break down cards from decks you can buy and if you happen to get one of those cards in a pack randomly you cannot break that down either for any tokens. If you get a shiny or better card then it\\'ll break down for more tokens.\\n\\nThis is why you can easily see people with tier zero decks so easily because they just copy paste a good deck. Another plus to some but a minus to others is that their ban list is different from the updated ban list so some cards that are banned, limited, or semi-limited are changed.',\n",

       "  'review': 'While it\\'s far more free-to-play friendly than Duel Links, you\\'ll likely need to pony up some dosh if you have a \\'very\\' specific deck idea in mind.\\n\\nThat said, this is the best simulator online for Yu-Gi-Oh! and everything from the visuals to the music, the flow of the game and more is all great. It seems to have nearly every card in the game, aside from a few that haven\\'t been in any of the video games for a long time such as Shuttleroid and Neo Air Hummingbird, those in particular likely due to some kind of legal issue.\\n\\nThe sets seem to be the ones that are released in both the TCG/OCG, if it\\'s only out in one then it\\'s not in the game, and the banlist seems to follow OCG but an older or modified OCG banlist, Maxx \"C\" is at 3 and so is Chicken Game and so forth.\\n\\nThey are very generous with early gems, the first 2 decks you want to build can almost completely be built off of F2P gems as long as your deck isn\\'t full of exclusively Ultra Rare cards or something to that effect. I\\'m guessing as events come down the line we\\'ll have more opportunities to get gems, and maybe gems with each new box release like they did with Duel Links.\\n\\nRanked is hit or miss, you\\'ll continuously get rewards as long as you win but once you get to Gold ranking and higher you\\'ll start to face a lot more meta decks and it\\'ll be harder to use your fun decks, though you may be able to push through if you augment your fun decks with meta support like Nibiru, Maxx \"C\", Ash Blossom, Ghost Mourning/Effect Veiler, Infinite Impermanence and so forth. Just be prepared to surrender a lot(you\\'ll get no reward if you surrender, though) if you don\\'t want to wait for your opponent to do an 8 minute turn when you have a bricked hand and don\\'t think you can make a board on your next turn or break their board, games in modern Yu-Gi-Oh! are over in like 5 turns at most from what I\\'ve seen.\\n\\nI do have to wonder what the state of the game will be once the first events start rolling out though, because you\\'re looking at about $2 per pack and each pack has 8 cards, with a 10 pull ($20~) guaranteeing you atleast a SR or UR if you got no UR in your last 10 pull of that pack. The crafting system is good, though with any 3 of one rarity card being equal to any 1 card you want of that rarity, and with foils giving you even more up to possibly getting a 1:1 exchange from \"Royal\" foils.\\n\\nFor now, there\\'s no equal, ez 10/10. Because people have to earn cards not \\'everyone\\' is running meta and I can find plenty of ranked duels to rank up on even with a fun deck like Toons. This game could get expensive if you immediately want 3+ playable decks day 1, but I\\'m hopeful that there will be ample opportunities to earn gems in the future.',\n",

Instead, you have to use the \"public decks\" feature, but browsing for decks here is annoying since you don\\'t know who made it or if it\\'s any good.  (Yes I netdeck, there are 6000+ cards in modern yugioh and I haven\\'t played since synchros, also this game is not very f2p friendly.)  There are a multitude of other UI nitpicks I could make, but for brevity I won\\'t.  \\n\\nKonami couldn\\'t help but make the monetization as greedy as possible.  As a new player, you\\'re flooded with 15k or so gems in the first day or two of play.  Don\\'t let this fool you, as it quickly slows to a trickle.  It\\'s enough to make ~1 deck with good pulls, but decks after that are going to take substantially more effort.  The packs are absurd.  If you\\'re looking for specific cards, say, for a shaddoll deck, you\\'ll first have to either pull or craft a SR or UR card in their \"secret\" pack.  This unlocks the *privilege* of being able to pull from that secret pack.  The catch?  You only unlock the secret pack for 24 hours.  So if you\\'ve got a pet project deck, you\\'ll need to plan far ahead to efficiently spend your gems.  I can see no reason for this other than to encourage unwise spending of gems.  \\n\\nCrafting materials are limited to card rarities.  What this means is if you want a specific ultra rare you\\'ll have to dismantle 3 other ultra rares to get that card.  Considering most good decks seem to have ~20 URs, ~20SRs, and ~15 N/R cards, you\\'ll be heavily bottle-necked with thousands of N/R crafting points to spend, but 0 UR and SR crafting points to spend. \\n\\nThe tutorial is terrible for new players.  I already knew most of what it was going over, but if someone came in completely green, the tutorial would probably not help them much.  For example, there\\'s a \"tutorial\" duel on chaining.  You would think that Konami would give you a deck with a preset hand to emphasize chaining effects together, but instead the only tutorial element is a paragraph explaining chaining to you, and then you just play through with your trash starter deck.  The summoning tutorials at least do this, but could have done more to explain detaching for xyz or arrows for links.  Incidentally, the \"starter\" decks they offer you are all trash in a tier of their own; if you use them in anything other than solos you\\'re going to chain losses, even in bronze.  \\n\\nAs far as gameplay is concerned, I don\\'t have much to say about it.  Modern yugioh is two simultaneous games of solitaire, you\\'ll spend about 10 minutes putting out your combo, and then your opponent will do the same.  Games with more grindy decks can last an extremely long time (for a card game).  If you\\'re new you\\'ll spend 90% of your opponents turn reading the novel of information thrown at you to understand what\\'s going on.  I knew this going in and I don\\'t mark it as a negative, but it\\'s something to be aware of.',\n",

The first week or two are fine and hands out plenty of gems to fuel your booster pack itch, but after that, you get bugger all from missions and ranked matches. To the point where you would be lucky to get 1000 gems (a 10  pack opening) in one week. Clearly meant to force spendage, to which again, prices are HORRENDOUS.\\n\\nNot FTP friendly UNLESS youre willing to abuse the multiple Konami account exploit and keep track of them, and are willing to keep going through the hassle of recovering time and again, jut to get multiple accounts to make multiple decks of differing types, which is Anti user friendly except for those hardcore bois out there. So, if youre \"lazy\" like i am and just want the one account, MAKE SURE YOU GET ONE COMPETETIVE DECK FIRST, because if you dont and go for the fun ones, youre stuck with them for at least a month before you earn the gems needed to make another, or pay for it.\\n\\nPlus, i vividly recall seeing a statement of using different rulesets and banlists  when i first went to download it, which, there are none. Stuck with the one current ruleset, and a banlist that is neither an old or current state, EG, certain cards are unlimited, when theyre supposed to be totally banned, or restricted ones, that are unrestricted. The game seriously needs these variables, as not everyone likes playing with certain rulesets and formats. With how many players have come back after quitting across all the various eras, they NEED formats for us returning players to play, Classic for example would be a big improvement, no XYZ, Synchro, Pendulum, Links or 15+ special summons in a turn and waiting for 5 minutes for the other person to stop jacking off over the board, just quick turns and dynamic back and forth gameplay.\\n\\nFrankly, if you want a good YGO experience, youd be better off downloading one of those emulators like Dawn of a New Era or whatever its called and just play that. Current banlists, multiple rulesets, all cards available, no monetization. Hopefully they fix these issues and maybe ill change my opinion. But for now, Friends only duels are the only saving grace, and even then theyll get boring and mundane when were all stuck playing with the same decks over and over, because again, dont get enough gems to make more decks.\\n\\n~ Further addition to review and after further play (Against my better judgment) The event that happened was okay for rewards, but still not enough to warrant a change of opinion over the economy, and the event itself was pretty crap between the players that just suicided themselves, and the fact that the event had absolutely NOTHING to do with what it was named after. Could play it and complete it withohut ever even touching an XYZ card. \\n\\nSecondly, the amount of time wasters and server issues here are STAGGERING. Do NOT be surprised if you end up sitting in your chair for 5-10 minutes just because they take a minute EVERY TIME they play ONE card, or not even play ANY cards, just sit there clicking random things to they dont get a time out, and then the servers decide to crap on you, making you have wasted 20-30 minutes waiting for these douchebags, and in some cases, register it as a loss and set you back in the ranked ladder for no god damn reason. There NEEDS to be a turn time limit or SOMETHING because not even in person locals are as god awful as this shit is. Possibly the worst YGO experience you could get, including Duel Links.',\n",

       "  'review': \"No ban list (not even a intent to make one), no real dealing with rampant cheaters, no announcement acknowledging the bot issues, they added ~30 (probably less, can't be bothered to count) new cards and filled the 80 card pack with existing cards that are pretty meh, which is the only way to get said new cards in a diluted pool, rankings basically don't exist, the events feel like a chore, the community is toxic like...there is no moderation on the steam boards and people just whine and complain all the time and its always the same stuff. It's a free game that knows how to milk you for money in the long run while looking generous for your first two weeks or so, and then its gonna bleed you dry while not actually improving anything. The real problems are things konami won't address, they will toss a pre-planned event your way that is...not fun, reward you with silly legacy packs that clog your inventory and you can't do anything about and you can't even dismantle the NON-Legacy cards you have if you get a legacy version of that card added to it (have 3 copies, but then get a legacy copy? you can't dismantle ANY of that card anymore. Forever. Good job konami). \\n\\nEnd of the day? The community is toxic and grating, konami doesn't care and frankly the game is more a chore to play then fun. I am not talking about the gameplay at all, some people legit like meta decks. Some people like old school stuff. Some people like 3rd rate decks and some just enjoy crushing their opponent in efficient one turn combos. That's all cool and all, but regardless of where you fall, there is ALWAYS someone on the forums whining about the thing you like or doing the thing you hate. Don't recommend.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'If you\\'re a new or returning player please read this before playing.\\n\\nIt\\'s a good game. The \"not recommended\" label goes out to all the new players and returnes frustrated after jumping into a ranked game and being completely stomped by some guy somehow just summoning a giant golden zombie straight from his deck. I\\'m that guy and I\\'m sorry.\\n\\nMaster Duel is definitely the most visually appealing digital Yu-Gi-Oh experience we ever had. A lot of thought went into the flow of gameplay and how the UI is navigated and playing it feels great. If you know what you\\'re doing. Konami released this game in a somewhat unfortunate state. It\\'s most important objective should\\'ve been to pull in and retain new and returning players into a card game that is notoriously difficult to learn. Currently it fails in that regard, maybe once the ranks have settled that might be different, but as of now if you\\'re jumping into a game against a real opponent chances are you\\'re going to have no idea just how much your old favorite deck from 2010 has been outclassed by pretty much everything that\\'s been released within the last few years.\\n\\nRanked play being the only matchmaking option will turn away a lot of people. Over time Master Duel is going to need some game mode that puts duelists on a level playing field. Something that makes knowledge of the current meta irrelevant. Something like a draft mode to slowly introduce players to many of the cards they have missed over the last 15 years. If they want to take inspiration from the community, some sort of progression series system would be absolutely perfect here guiding new players slowly through the history of the game, perhaps even three to five sets at a time instead of just one.\\n\\nSo if you\\'re not someone who has actively followed the game for some time, at least wait until events, other game modes, alternative formats or more banlists are implemented. Konami has something with a lot of potential here and I\\'d hate seeing all the new players walk away from it in frustration.\\n\\nThere are alternatives to this game that shall not be named here out of respect for the community and the developers of master duel, but if you want to get back into Yu-Gi-Oh you might want to start there. Look up GOAT format, that\\'s the game you remember from back then. Make your way up from there, there are other fan formats with limited card pools. Yu-Gi-Oh back then was sometimes just as frustrating and unbalanced as it is today, even worse during some infamous formats. Give it a chance, maybe just do it somewhere else.',\n",

[/h1]\\n\\nActually, this game came as a surprise when I personally thought the Yu-Gi-Oh card game was about to completely collapse. Aftel Legacy of The Duelist (that was advertised for so long and yet was a terrible failure) and Duel Links (that sucked because it tried changing the game\\'s format, making it into a speed-based game when it\\'s originally a strategy card game), comes Master Duel... The game that kept the original format of the Yu-Gi-Oh card game we\\'ve always loved... although with the greed you\\'d expect from Konami!\\n\\nNow, if you\\'re one to say that this is NOT a Pay2win game, I\\'d like to point out just a few points that will instantly ruin your line of thinking! Basically, you play duels online versus other human players (and the game is very populated at the moment of writing this review). You get gems by winning these duels and progressing through the current Battlepass, gems being the game\\'s currency that you use to buy packs.. that MAY or MAY NOT include the cards that you\\'re looking for to build your deck.\\n\\nThe thing is, the gems you win (without buying anything) are quite scarce... Considering challenges offer like 250 gems daily, a pack costs 100 gems and winning would award like 20 gems every five wins or so! Basically you\\'d need 1000 gems for like ONE card that you really want in your deck. In short, you\\'d want to spend like thousands of dollars in gems to build a deck that can hold its ground on the top tier ranked gameplay. Furthermore; and because Konami is so smart, the top-tier cards will obviously cost Ultra Rare materials... which translates into needing more than a couple thousand gems to craft and there is absolutly no way you\\'re getting that many gems \"FOR FREE\"!\\n\\nAnother issue I could think of is that once you get to Gold you\\'d start really hating this game. Those top-tier decks that everyone and their siblings are using their mommas\\' debit card to pay for would literally end the duel in the first turn ever... I\\'m not even kidding, I\\'ve seen opponents pick \"Go First\" then deal 8000 of direct damage through card effects while I sip my coffee in complete awe thinking to myself: \"This MUST be a GLITCH, I haven\\'t even had a turn yet\". Is the game Pay2Win? No... Is it Pay2PlayAtTopTierRanks? Yes, yes it most definitely is. \\n\\nHowever, online gameplay is not all there is to the game! You can duel with friends and really feel the heart of the cards in a Solo Campaign Mode that teaches you about tons of dueling archetypes (which you will never ever use once you figure out a way to One Turn Kill the opponent using the decks you paid real money for) and I recommend you go through that first before you spend those precious early free gems on anything. Hopefully they patch the game later on where they limit cards that can end duels before they start, but I\\'m not holding my breath, it\\'s Konami we\\'re talking about here after all... If it helps them get money from kids with low self-esteem, they will keep it! The early Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters days will always be the best. It\\'s a 6/10 strategy card game from some of the greediest devs on earth.\\n\\nIT\\'S TIME TO W-W-W-W-W-WATCH YOU ONE TURN DUEL!',\n",

Most decks play themselves for about 5 minutes while you watch them search, special summon, search some more, special summon some more, search even more, special summon even more until they have a near unstoppable field.\\n\\nRemember when high level / rank monsters actually required a substantial turn, cost, and effort investment to summon? Yeah, me neither. Remember when the Graveyard was a bad thing except for Zombie decks? Yeah, me neither. Remember when obnoxious cards like Harpie's Feather Duster and Brionac were banned? Yeah, me neither. Remember when getting a positive effect from a card leaving your field meant needing to trick your opponent into destroying it instead of getting a free Link 1 summon? Yeah, me neither. Remember when dueling had lots of fun back and forth, risk and reward interactions? Yeah... me neither.\\n\\nI've lost track of how many duels I sat there rolling my eyes in disgust because playing with any fun deck at all is impossible; even Counter Fairies get steamrolled now because the opponent can just endlessly search and summon so much with their opening hand that I can't even begin to negate all the bullshit. My only regret was not learning this until after I dumped money into the game...\\n\\nThen to add insult to injury, we can't dismantle cards you get from Legacy Packs or duel rewards - clogging your inventory with cards you'll never want or use. And once the free and discounted gems run dry, good luck continuing to build anything fun.\\n\\nCan we please at least have a format that makes casual decks viable? Or better yet, a new or alternate set of Master Rules that slams the breaks on search and summon abuse? Until then, the only fun part of this game is the Solo Mode.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Don\\'t listen to thise saying it\\'s \"Pay to Win\" as many have said. Can you spend enough money to get a full deck? Yes. BUT, with the amount of free gems you get, it\\'s ridiculous to say this is even remotely p2w. You can even buy premium cosmetics with the earnable in-game currency. \\n\\nSo far I\\'ve gotten 10000+ gems during my first day of playing without spending a cent (what about $150+ would get you) and have a fully built deck I could take to an IRL tournament and do well with. The pack RNG is very forgiving, and you can break down cards you don\\'t want to craft any card you\\'d like to get with a conversion rate of 3 cards broken down to 1 card you want. \\n\\nIt\\'s important to realize that you don\\'t need every card, nor is it realistic to acquire every card, it\\'s not like you have every card IRL anyway. So far the monetization is one of the most forgiving, if not best, forms of monetization in any yugioh game konami has produced and it contains nearly every single card in the game outside of a handful of things not added from more recently released packs and already unusable cards. \\n\\nThe game still is a little rough around the edges here and there in a few departments such as graphics and some menu translations, but that will get better over time I imagine. Overall though, this is the best official yugioh game out there for playing the modern, normal card game and I\\'m excited to see what more the game had to offer.',\n",

       "  'review': \"TL;DR summary: I can't recommend it as much as not recommend it. It is Yu-Gi-Oh!, only cross platform and free to play*\\n\\n* = You will need to spend money (eventually) to get cards. Here's how it works:\\n\\nThe game has 3 starting boosters available currently. You use gems (in game currency) to pull from these packs. The random pulls you get will unlock 'timed boosters' (available for 24 hours), which will let you pull from a small pool of cards if you're chasing specific rares.\\n\\nAnd with the game having a finite amount of 'easy gems' to farm, you're eventually going to need to spend money to get more if you want to chase certain rares for a certain deck type. You can try to grind them for free playing dailies and PvP, but if your win rate is bad with your deck, it will take longer and get more frustrating for those who can't take the heavy losing. And considering you're going to meet those who shelled out for high-tier, even god-tier decks, with more money being spent than you...yeah.\\n\\nThe game is also cross-platform too. Can play on mobile, PC, and console. It's perhaps the first real universal Yu-Gi-Oh! client that we have gotten in a while. That is one benefit to the game. One account is usable across all platforms, so you can have access to it anywhere you want to play the game (it's a Konami ID type of account).\\n\\nAnd it's new. So consider that while things are very limited right now, there's no telling what direction the game may take. But given the accessibility of card-getting in the game, making a viable deck to grind with so you can  get more cards, and make more viable decks, is really a test of patience and how free-to-play you want to go.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'You’re X-1 about to top your first regional. You’re so excited even coming off your last loss. You know you played well, and that’s just the name of the game.\\nYou hear over the loudspeaker,\\n“Yugioh Players, pairings are being posted for round 9, our final round”\\nYou wade through the crowd of players to get up to the pairings list. One more win and you’re top 8! You could hardly contain your excitement. You find your last name. Table 4. Then, your eyes slide over to your opponent. Your heart sinks.\\n“Kotton, Jesse”\\nOkay, no need to panic. You’ve been up against better players than yourself before. There’s no need to be intimidated by a big name.\\nYou go and sit down at your table. It seems like the crowd starts to thin out as most people have taken their seats. You look around, no sign of your opponent. You check the clock and it hasn’t started yet.\\nYou see other players taking their decks out and getting ready to start their games. The chatter fills the room as you look around for anyone else walking up to the table. You see no one.\\n“Players, welcome to round 9, you have 40 minutes. You may begin.”\\nStill no Jesse.\\nThe clock ticks down, you get to the 38 minute mark as you see him stroll up swiftly, out of breath, and take a seat. He lays his mat out and effortlessly pulls his main and extra out in a single motion.\\nYou say “high roll” he says “sure.”\\nYou roll a 9 he gets a 4.\\n“I’ll go first,” you say as you draw your starting hand. Not the best, but it’ll get the job done.\\n“Normal Seyfert, link for Striker Dragon”\\nKotton says, “hold on, I have a play”\\nHe thinks for a moment, then lays a card from his hand into his S/T zone.\\n“Shaddoll Fusion”\\n“Wait, it’s my turn, you can’t do that,” you say.\\nKotton begins searching his deck. He lays out monsters one at a time, Beast, Wendi, Hedgehog, Trick Clown, Ariel. He even throws a Construct from his Extra into the graveyard.\\n“Summon Winda. Declare chain links...” he begins counting up to 6.\\nYou repeat, “you can’t do that”\\nHe starts coughing into his sleeve. “Sorry”, he says squinting, as he begins looking through his deck to resolve backwards.\\n“Wait, this whole play is illegal,” you raise your hand and shout “Judge!”\\nA judge walks over. “What seems to be the problem?”\\n“He activated Shaddoll Fusion on my turn. You can’t do that!”\\nThe judge thinks for a moment, he looks at Kotton and asks “who’s turn player?”\\nKotton says, “he is”.\\nJudge says, “okay, is this the first time this has happened today?”\\nHe looks toward you and you nod. He thinks for a moment.\\n“Alright, game loss.”\\nYour mouth drops wide open as the judge signs your slip “GL” next to your name. You ask for an appeal.\\n“Denied,” you hear from Kotton as he continues resolving his chain, slapping more cards around and tossing your Seyfert on the floor to banish it. Kotton begins sweating, dripping all over the table. Smells like fries. The judge walks away.\\nYou plead with the players nearby and ask them if they saw what he did but they shrug and plead ignorance. You begin crying softly as Jesse reveals Danger Nessie from his hand.\\nHe shuffles his hand into his deck, fans it out and gestures for you to choose.\\nYou reach in and pull out a single, greasy card. Yes! It’s the Nessie! You drop it in his graveyard as Kotton picks up his deck, searches through it and pulls out another Nessie. He summons it, draws a new hand, then says “draw 1”.\\nYou raise your hand again to call a judge, as you know Danger Nessie is limited to 1 and there’s no way anyone can rule that against you.\\n“Judge!”\\nKotton begins coughing uncontrollably, disregarding his sleeve and beginning to cough all over the table. Other players barely seem to notice as they’re deep into their own game. He starts licking your playmat as you plead him to stop since you never even got to declare your Striker Dragon as Chain Link 1.\\nHe picks up your Extra Deck and takes a deep exhale on each individual card until he gets to the final card: Borrelsword.\\nHe licks his lips as he pulls Borrelsword out of its sleeve and starts deepthroating it, making sure that every inch is soaking wet.\\nHe drops the sopping mess that used to be Borresword into his board and says “attack, attack, effect target, attack for game?”\\nYou drop to your knees, sobbing, as you can barely squeeze out a single word through the tears. You look at Kotton with a begging look in your eye.\\n“Why? Why are you doing this?”\\nKotton leans across the table as close to you as possible and whispers into your ear, his lips still coated in blue ink.\\n“Worlds points, bro”',\n",

       "  'review': 'I use to be a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh! but man has it changed. It might be that I just suck at the game but EVERY SINGLE duel is the same. Other players First turn: special summon this into this into this into this = 5 monsters on the field all at least 2500 power level with like 4 trap cards ready to go. Spend 15 minutes doing all that to finally pass the turn over. *looks at hand* oh I only have two monsters and 5 trap cards hmmm *tries one special summon* other player: \"yeah no, I have a  trap card to block that\" round already over. Dude does 8k damage and kills me in three turns. Even if it\\'s my turn first which for some reason just happens very rarely, I still just get shit on anyways because I do all the special summons just to have some dude play a spell card that says \"if other player did anything their turn then negate all those actions\" then all of sudden I again have nothing on the field. Also the game is already pay to play because it has gems that allow you to buy packs and decks that can blow anyone out of the water. Like I said it\\'s probably because I haven\\'t played the game in years but as a returning player or even for new players looking to play  Yu-Gi-Oh for the first time I wouldn\\'t recommend it because you won\\'t have time to learn everything and trust me there are tons of rules and the rules depend on the deck and the wind in the air so as of right now it just isn\\'t fun if you don\\'t already have years into the game.',\n",

Combining this with multiple duel worlds that you can freely switch between as well as an event almost always being available that offers its own rewards means there\\'s almost always something to do in the single-player. This slows down significantly as the requirements to level up the stages gets higher and higher and the player runs out of characters to unlock.\\n\\nThe multiplayer of Duel Links is a different beast. There are only a handful of decks in the meta, and most of them require an absurd amount of grinding and/or paying real money to get the cards for. This is because some of the cards are found exclusively in structure decks, and to obtain a second or third copy you are required to purchase these decks with money. Even with a meta deck, you might find yourself in a losing streak due to bad luck match-ups. The rewards for actually dueling in ranked are pitiful, and playing against the same decks over and over while using the same cards really sucks the fun out of it.\\n\\nMaster Duel feels like the reverse situation. First, the idea of basing the single player on the lore of the cards is an excellent idea. There is some real potential there like the World Chalice lore, which the devs knew since it is the finale of the campaign and the longest set of duels here. Unfortunately, it\\'s executed in perhaps the most boring fashion I\\'ve seen in any single player campaign for a CCG. Each campaign scenario consists of a tutorial match that is rather useless, providing you with a predetermined hand, field, and draw in order to kill your AI opponent which it handholds you through. You then proceed to a \"real\" duel which is, invariably, a mirror match against the AI with the exact same deck that you\\'re given to use. Mirror matches are never fun, and that goes doubly so while playing the AI. You essentially play 1-2 turns and if the AI has the advantage, you just surrender and restart the duel ad-nauseam until you get the right hand and draws to win.\\n\\nEach scenario is bookended with a short non-animated cutscene with some noticeably poor writing. I\\'m not sure if this is an issue with the translation or the writing was never good to begin with. When the writing is not just confusingly worded it\\'s often just redundant restating the same information in a different way two or three times for no discernable reason.\\n\\nOn the bright side, playing through the campaign gives you elemental orbs which unlocks a branching path of the scenario which is usually another mirror match or two, however you can also play each mission again with a deck of your own choice and you receive a new set of rewards for doing so. The rewards provided in general are pretty decent, ranging from icons, 3-sets of cards, and a good amount of gems.\\n\\nMaster Duel also enters the 21st century and finally adds card dusting, allowing you to dismantle extra copies of your cards and use the resource received to generate new cards.\\n\\nThe way card packs are handled here are strange. Outside of the structure packs, you have a few packs to choose from including a \"master\" pack that includes all the cards, and a smaller (though still quite large) set of selected \"powerful\" cards. Opening any of these packs has a chance to unlock a \"secret pack\" which is only available for 24 hours after you unlock it. These secret packs contain archetype specific cards like Lunalight or Gladiator Beasts. If you lack the gems to open these secret packs when you unlock them, you lose your chance until if and when they show up again. \\n\\nIn any case, because of the generous amount of gems given to new players and the dusting mechanic, building a viable deck for multiplayer is much, much easier than Duel Links where you\\'re forced to dig through large booster boxes over and over. This being the full ruleset of YGO and not the trimmed-back rules of Duel Links means you also have many more cards to choose from, so if it\\'s an official multiplayer experience you\\'re looking for, this is probably the way to go. \\n\\nHopefully more content will be added to the single-player with time, and they\\'ll polish what\\'s already there.',\n",

       "  'review': \"drytron sim 2022\\n\\nJokes aside \\nThis game does have negative reviews, from people who haven't played YGO since their McDonalds Elemental Hero Beatdown in school. They are going to complain about game pace, and meta, etc. Odds are they suck at the game and always did. Realistically, if you've played YuGiOh in any recent timeframe, you know what you're getting into, and you know what the 'nostalgia gamers' are like. Do you 'HAVE TO PLAY META OR YOU WILL LOSE'? Nope. Is every turn 5 minutes of 50 cards comboing? Nope. \\nIn fact, a lot of things they complain about  in their reviews have been in the game for a very, very long time, they just never played the game at a level where it was relevant. \\nI've been playing since LOB came out, most of the complaints people have aren't based in reality and are cope for just not understanding the game. \\n\\nThis is the best YGO sim in a long time. I really hope official support continues on it. I'm a Flunder player so I really want BODE in the game right now, but I can survive without it. \\n\\nI think that this definitely is giving unofficial sims a run for their money. While you don't get everything out of the gate, it is very easy to get up and running with something that will do you well. \\n\\nF2P is very fair so far, solo mode is fun. The ban list is... interesting. Not going to be for everyone but Dragoon and Mine is banned and Maxx C is at 3 so I'm happy honestly \\n\\n\\nFrom a UI/UX perspective, everything is top notch. Building decks is very easy and I don't feel like I'm fistfighting the UI when I search for cards\\n\\nMusic is great, sound in general is great, the dynamic music is really really cool and actually switches when you'd expect it to. Animations are great, PC settings aren't spectacular but they do the job \\n\\nI am VERY pleasantly surprised by Master Duel, I really like it a lot, to the point where I've been spending more time on it than [SIM THAT ALSO HAS RANKED THAT I'M NOT NAMING BECAUSE KONAMI POLICE] and got plat on day 1ish.\\nGame good, keep it good, please don't mess this up, for the love of god\",\n",

I get it looks like Im salty since I haven't followed the meta since XYZ summons came out like 6 years ago, but I am sick of tired of how long opponents take. I feel like I should have won due to time outs at this point. Last match I decided to check times. First time by the opponent took a total of 9 minutes (real time, not the apparently useless counter). My turn took 27 seconds. the opponent then took 7 minutes and 25 seconds to summon 2 monsters and activate 1 spell. My next turn took 2 minutes 10 seconds. At this point Im losing and Im wide open for a direct attack to finish the game. It then takes my opponent 3 minutes and 10 seconds fucking around with effects that literally did nothing (returned my card from the banish pile to the GY only to ban it again but disable its clearly not applicable affect) and then attack.\\n\\nThis is half the time, where my turns are efficient and no longer than 3 minutes when Im combo-ing stuff together but opponents can take an upwards of 10 minutes link summoning like 5 thigns, multiple XYZ summons and chaining affects and it just sucks ALL the fun out of the game when I get 3 turns in 30 minutes\",\n",

       "  'review': 'This is a great game from a technical perspective. The developers deserved to be commended for bringing such a comprehensive Yu-Gi-Oh experience to a wide audience for the first time. (No, Duel Links does not count. The rules are fundamentally different due to the limited field size.)\\n\\nUnfortunately the game is marred by the fact that Konami has never been particularly great at taking care of their game. Master Duel has to live with years of particularly lackluster banlists and increasing power creep that it has been saddled with from the paper game. It leaves the online format dominated by strictly necessary hand traps, and turn-one lock out combos. \\n\\nThe unfortunate state of the game\\'s balance aside, Master Duel also suffers from currently limited competitive offerings. Clearly the infrastructure is being built, but at the moment the (admittedly stellar) duel room feature can accomodate community tournaments with ease. But as of this writing, there are no official tournaments, or prize support, which is essential for any serious competitive card game.\\n\\nThe starting funds you receive are generous, but the ranked rewards per season are pretty terrible, and these are by far the largest source of gems in the game over the long term. The game\\'s economy is \"balanced\" around throwing you an extensive amount of currency at the start of the game. It is easy to acquire a single meta deck rather easily and achieve a high rank if you know what you\\'re doing.\\n\\nBut the strengths and much of the fun of Yu-Gi-Oh can be found in decks that are perhaps less well known, and after you acquire your first deck, perhaps afteryour second, the gem acquisition rate slows to a crawl. This isn\\'t necessarily a problem, but long time fans of the game will know that the meta can shift arbitrarily thanks to Konami\\'s decision making, from rules changes (such as the new pendulum rules, or the infamous release of link monsters), to heavy bans. There is no stated policy about ban refunds anywhere, although since it seems Konami is planning on allowing for some form of banlist customization in the future, perhaps this won\\'t be as necessary as it might be in other games.\\n\\nStill, the economy is meant to be deceptive and draw you in, tricking you into thinking you\\'re getting more than you are. Players who do well are punished, while players who are not as experienced are at a disadvantage since they will almost invariably waste limited resources on decks that might be bad and lose frequently, encouraging them to spend. For instance, if you hit Plat 1 in the first season, you start at Gold 5. You do NOT get rewards for skipped ranks, and the reward for going from Rookie to Bronze is three times higher than ranking up in Plat, even though Plat takes more games and is much harder. I myself managed to hit Plat 1, and there was no further incentive to play. No leaderboard, nothing beyond an arbitrary point where the game goes \\'alright you ran on the hamster wheel enough\\'. However, people enjoy competition. And when Konami inevitably starts banning things on Master Duel, as well as adding new (and power-creeped) archetypes, people will be tempted to spend great sums of money to keep up with the meta. \\n\\nNo one is saying that Konami isn\\'t allowed to make money, obviously. But their current business arrangement in this game is anti-competitive and anti-consumer. I enjoy Yu-Gi-Oh immensely, but changes need to be made.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I’ve been playing Yugioh for a long time, thinking way back to potentially 2005-2006.  I dumped hundreds of hours onto World Championship 2007 on the NDS simply because I loved the game but as a youth didn’t have the friends/the money to play.  As I got older things pretty much stayed the same, I’d get into the game really hardcore for a few months and then lose interest when it felt like the monetary ceiling forced me to prematurely plateau.  We all know Yugioh is expensive, paying 90$ for dpe or 100 for a single copy of forbidden droplet is never gonna feel that great whether you’re playing casually or competitively.  I feel that part of the appeal of a duel sim like Edopro is access to this game from the comfort of your home and fair enough it’s free.  Say what you will about the premium products like Legacy of the Duelist but at least everything was accessible as long as you played.  With things the way they are now in Master duel, you’re lucky to get enough to grind out one 10 booster package a week IF you play a bunch everyday AND win.  Playing the same deck into the same 4-5 matchups everyday gets kind of boring.  Boarding into eldlich setting 4 passing, watching a drytron player combo off and end on herald with 5-6 negates is prime snooze material.  I’ve seen enough guys loop lyrilusc into udf with simorgh-> barrier statue to last a lifetime.  Point being that with enough games played, you will just reach plat 5 naturally.  The decks that try to innovate or play for fun slowly fade away and are replaced by the aforementioned.  If you play meta/ just want to play to win that’s fine but personally the game has gotten stale.  A lack of new content(the last couple core booster sets), laughable ranked rewards, and no announced schedule for solo mode/dueling events result in something I think can die out sooner rather than later if things don’t change soon.  Obviously I’ve been very negative thus far but the game is fun when it works.  Playing 1v1 lobbies with friends is amazing once you navigate the labyrinthine ui.  Watching the countless animations for boss monster summons is uniquely satisfying.  At the start watching this unique format was fairly interesting but I think it’s about time to switch it up.  With the game as it is now, I can recommend it to returning players and brave new ones, just brace yourself with some snacks when you inevitably vs any of the top 5.  Good luck and have fun. :)',\n",

       "  'review': \"Solo/Tutorial Mode is fun, though it does a poor job at teaching you about how the game is actually played.\\nPrices for Gems (in-game currency) are absolutely insane and totally not worth it, BUT you can easily create a competitive meta deck at no cost with freely given gems, so it's not a P2W game. Game runs fine, with almost no bugs or any performance issues.\\n\\nThe pros end there. Master Duel is a multiplayer-competitive focused game, and the ranked duels couldn't be any more frustrating and boring. You are basically forced to build a Meta deck you either know from playing the real game or look it up on the internet, Meta meaning 5 minutes long first-turns where you play pretty much every op card in your deck so as to OTK (one-turn kill) your opponent and/or make sure he can't do anything at all.\\n\\nRanked gameplay, in the end, comes down to a coin toss: whoever goes first with the most broken OTK deck wins. Period.\\nThe only possible (but unlikely) exception is if the first-turn player bricks, that is, draws a crappy hand. It still comes down to luck, so it never feels rewarding let alone exciting.\\nThere's no real skill or strategy involved, just sheer dumb luck and playing the same broken card combos over and over again. It sounds stupid just talking about it.\\n\\nLegacy of the Duelist does a way better job at being a single-player Yu-Gi-Oh! game and even has a multiplayer mode. \\nThe casual mode leaves a lot to be desired, at least for now (February 6th 2022). \\n\\nSo even though Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel is technically a good game, the core competitive gameplay is not even remotely fun IMO and anything else the game offers is bland, unfinished and/or still to come who-knows-when.\\nEven though I didn't spend money on this game, I still feel cheated for wasting 70 hours playing this crap - which is about a couple minutes of actual gameplay, aside from looking up Meta decks and waiting between turns. Crazy, I know. LOL\\n\\nTL;DR Just go play Legacy of the Duelist if you want a decent single-player experience, Duel Links if you want faster-paced games*, or the actual card game if you want a decent ban list. There's no reason to play Master Duel.\\n\\n* EDIT: Master Duel is now available for mobile. According to the reviews there's some technical issues though.\",\n",

I would absolutely recommend new player be unafraid of netdecking to make decks that are either meta or cheap to start off with before trying to build your own deck as you get a decent surge of materials in the beginning that slows down to a trickle and you don't wanna be stuck with something that just gets broken in half for ranked or else you will kneecap your resource gain that much more.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I used to have good memories of this card game called Yu-Gi-Oh, sadly over the many years the game has become something boring. It typically takes 1 round to win or lose a duel and then it is an X amount of suffering until someones LP (lifepoints) are finally reduced to sub zero.\\n\\nBefore you had monsters with a rating (stars). 1 to 4 stars where summonable on the spot. For 5-6 monsters you had to sacrifice another monster and for the very powerful 7-8 star monsters you had to sacrifice 2 monsters. These could then be destroyed by a smart trap card allowing the player to turn the tides.\\n\\nNow you summon 1-4 cards NEVER, they are useless. 5-6  cards NEVER they are useless. Trap cards? well no use the enemy has monsters lvl 8 with a special effect, they are immune to trap and spell cards.  Even if you could it doesn't matter it is turn one and he can 'Special summon without tribute' his entire deck due to effects, trap or spell cards. 7 cards in your hand at start? Doesn't matter what you draw you alreayd have 7 cards in your hand allowing you to pick 2 cards of your choice from your deck, netting you the 14 cards you really want.\\n\\nTo summarize:\\nA duel takes place,\\nyou or your opponent has won, depending on sheer luck.\\nyou need 4 more rounds to either die or kill your opponent, but the game is already over.\\n\\nThe game itself is good enough, the devs aren't at fault, but the card game just died and my good childhood memories are gone. That said it is a free game, and I don't feel the micro transactions are forced. I recommend you try it, see if you like it. At most it cost you a bit of your time, but I am out of this game.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I've been playing yugioh primarily during elementary school and high school so I don't know anything about the competitive scene. I haven't really kept up with link summons, pendulums, etc. So adjusting to that format took a little while.\\n\\ntl;dr game is good. game needs to cater more towards casual players. needs more content.\\n\\nThe solo/story mode in the game covered from what I forgot about yugioh, although solo just gets really really old. it needs to be more rewarding.\\n\\nSpeaking of rewards: I can see it working... if the game wasn't heavily orientated on ranked play. I absolutely hate playing ranked matches. I'm more introverted when it comes to playing these highly competitive card games but I primarily just want to play with my friends. Which sucks because you don't get any mission rewards for just playing unranked matches so you either have to wait irl, play solos, or do ranked. I hope this changes in the future.\\n\\nThe gems kind of work similarly to BTD6 where it's not pay to win but you have to play through the game extensively to even begin starting to be fully decked out. This would really work out if the game just had a lot more content. I think the concept of copying public decks and the secret packs is a good idea! although since I don't know anything about meta and deck building, obtaining gems to experiment with stuff is NOT a good idea, which is why sites like dueling network or w/e just make it free. IDK THO IM JUST BAD!!! XDDD!! \\n\\nThe visuals are good. soundtrack is kinda wack, liked legacy of the duelist way more. The player boards just could be a little better, it just feels like I'm just playing a dota 2 custom game mode lol. IM OPTIMISTIC THO! \\n\\nLastly, THE RANKED. like I said, as a casual player. I do not like it. one reason is petty, I'm anti-social and I feel like it's really stress-inducing for me. It kinda gets old playing against the same blue-eyes decks. If I get steamrolled, whatever, I will move on with my day, but what pisses me off are people that take their sweet ass time. I cannot tell if people who are playing this game is just seriously overthinking about every single decision they're doing, but more often than not, I seriously have no idea what I'm doing and even when they're absolutely destroying me in like 1-2 turns, shit just feels like an eternity. \\n\\nI'm giving this a good review because generally I'm optimistic and I think we have the technology to make this an amazing game.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'i love yugioh, been playing since the first episode of the anime released in the states, played on and off for a decade so i know all the systems and mechanics added over the years, reached plat3-2 every ranked reset. but realistically i cant recommend this game to anyone whos trying to have fun. you que up ranked and 90% of the time you run into the same 4 decks that are really really good that basically require the pilot to misplay for them to lose. the ban list needs to be updated ASAP, but it wont. one would think with the abundance of cards this game has from ALL generations of yugioh that the balance would be amazing and youd see tons of skill expression from people running archetypes of all kinds even old ones that have gotten new support? nope just an eldlich player here drytron player there tri brigade user here. yes you can make your own meta deck and start winning but it doesnt feel the same as if you crafted a deck that YOU wanted and thought out for yourself and start winning games with. if you dont run one of the holy four meta decks in ranked you will lose almost every time unless your opponent misplays really badly or has unlucky draws (these decks are designed to have basically no unlucky draws and make every card you draw enable some type of play). for now only play this game with friends and the events, ranked once you get high enough is literally nothing but the same cards over and over again.',\n",

It seems as a month went by and half the players left all that is left is sweats playing the same 2 \"tier 0\" decks aka banquet or @\\'s. I have decided to write this review after facing and being ftk\\'d 6 duels in a row in plat rank by this deck, I think the event duels are mediocre, fun though only reason I have played since the meta swapped to being 3 or 4 decks only. I know replies will say to play the broken decks, but is that fun?...NO! With that being said, I still think this game is pretty good,  but if you like myself have found yourself bored of the stale and frankly disgusting META, try duel legacy, it\\'s super fun!',\n",

       "  'review': \"The Solo adventure is rather fun. Mostly because the CPU takes its turns quickly. Also teaches you the game in a very in depth play through. The tragedy of the game comes from it's replay value. Playing online is a nightmare. While the entire catalog of cards are available, this also means there is a lot to learn, almost too much. It's hard to play around cards when you don't know what exists. \\n\\nThe worst of it is this: TURNS TAKE TOO LONG. The game isn't the same way it was when some of us were playing as kids. Synchro, XYZ, and Link summons have no limit. It's been more common than I believe it should for the first turn of the game for opponents to take 8 minutes. (And I've been timing them.) It feels like I'm watching people beat me rather than having an interactive experience to try and fight back. Watching a movie of people beating me every other duel is torturous. \\n\\nMy recommendation to Konami: shorten the turn limits, make the opponents time limit visable to both players, limit the number of Synchro, XYZ, and Link summons, just like there is for Normal Summons. Doesn't have to be one per turn, but there needs to be a limit. While they are cool new mechanics, the endless amount of them per turn have ruined the interactiveness of the game. \\n\\nTL;DR: Play Solo mode, avoid Online.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"So... first of all: The game doesn't seem P2W, despite a lot of angry gamers claiming it is. The Gem prices are outragous, yes. But: you get a lot of packs for free, after finishing the tutorials/playing solo mode. (I now have a fully fledged Tri-Brigade Lyrilusc deck and 5000 gems to spare without spending any real money). The crafting system is immaculate, because you can just dismantle all the useless cards you pulled from the set and get those meta staples you actually want! Graphics and music are nice too I guess. The banlist leans heavily on the OCG one, which I don't think is bad necessarily, but there are a few funky cards that are legal (I'm looking at you Kaiser Collosseum [3] and Vanitys Emptiness [1]).\\n\\nTL:DR: Great game for fans of the (current) TCG/OCG, maybe a bit much for newer players/returnees, if they don't get any help.\\n\\nEdit: As a tip for anyone starting a new account: If you are looking for a specific archetype, you don't have to open master packs until you get the special pack. You can just craft a SR or UR from that archetype and that will (probably) open up the special pack. So: opening the 3 bundles with Ash, Lightning Storm and Solemn Judgement will give you 30 packs of Master Pack for a discount. All the useless UR and SRs you get can be dismantled for any other UR or SR of the archetype you want to build and violà: you will have enough gems for at least 2 full decks.\",\n",

I have more fun playing against top meta decks than whatever the fuck people are playing in gold, lol. Though I would really like to see Master Duel add other formats and more duel room customization in general. Like I totally understand just wanting to play an older format on this game. There is always an option for online simulators but like, they just don't have the polish of Master Duel. \\nTo those who keep making the same jokes about how long turns take, hi.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This game is CANCEROUS! Every good game mechanic the game has, is undermined by decks that start with a 10 minute first turn of continually link summoning ridiculous boards. When your turn finally comes and your opponent negates not one, not two, not three, BUT FOUR attempts at starting a play and you're left with an empty field, an empty hand, nothing to play and staring at an OTK... the game has big issues (I'm referring to the actual TCG, not necessarily the simulator itself). Whoever made pendulums cards, link cards and hand traps, NEEDS TO BE FIRED! The game has become ridiculously un-fun and focused on preventing play, instead of clashing strategies and monsters. This is a severe problem, especially if you like older archetypes, which are extremely poorly supported. Personally I really love Red-Eyes and Dark Magician and the only card these archetypes could have used to maybe have a chance at standing up to the ridiculous new decks and negates, is banned and unobtainable. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this garbage to anyone and I will not be supporting this. This is not a balanced game, nor is it even a strategy game. This is one of the most ridiculous gatcha gambling games I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. I cannot believe I'm saying this, but it's probably worse than Raid Shadow Legends.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Ultimately, Master Duel (Not to be confused with Duel Masters) is a solid representation of standard Yu-Gi-Oh!, for better or worse. Graphics and music are good, though returning players from back in the day may have some growing pains trying to catch up. It should be warned that this game is not for the casual player.\\n\\nWhile one can have fun playing Yu-Gi-Oh!, it can only be done so casually if you have friends and agree to limits. Much of the time, you will be in ranked play against duelists with supremely powerful decks that fill their board on the first turn with nigh-unbeatable monsters and a myriad of effects that negate your ability to even play a card. Keep in mind that the turn timer is at eight minutes for a reason as players will be constantly summoning, special summoning, XYZ summoning, Pendulum Summoning, and so on. If your deck is not as fine tuned as that, you get a bad hand, or simply don\\'t have a half-hour to sit as your opponent spends ridiculous amounts of time to play, then surrender is the best option; albeit it means you do not gain any benefits.\\n\\nThe above point should not be taken against the app, but rather the card game itself. Unlike most other card games, Yu-Gi-Oh! does not cycle out cards based on sets, but instead limits a handful of cards deemed too powerful. This is more akin to what other games call \"unlimited\" format.\\n\\nThere is a story mode you can play, however it only serves to advertise an archetype filled with rare monsters. The story is just a few kinetic scenes that vaguely hint at the archetype\\'s backstory; nothing really engrossing. What is the draw of the story mode is the use of loaner decks as you complete challenges. The first few challenges in a story are hand-held tutorials that teach an archetype\\'s playstyle. To help with this, the game gives you loaner decks to try out. The rewards for completing these challenges range from a few gems (game currency), cards, and attribute orbs that act as keys to unlock more challenges.\\n\\nThe booster pack system is an interesting take. There are no packs resembling real-world boosters. Rather, there is a base pack and a pair of archetype packs open to purchase. Small numbers of cards outside the archetype are scattered throughout and unlock \"secret packs\". Secret packs are available to purchase for a day and are themselves other archetypes in the game. A player with gems to spend might have thirty plus secret packs to choose from when they are done looking around.\\n\\nIn summary, Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel is a solid app, though the game suffers from it\\'s own mechanics. Entertainment comes in brief bursts of ah-hah moments, getting to unwrap packs, and the rare chance you go first in a duel and can mop an opponent before they can act. Much of the time, however, you will sit and wait, and wait, and feel bored and frustrated.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This game saved my life.\\n\\nI am 25.\\n\\nMy ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.\\n\\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\\n\\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\\n\\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn\\'t beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\\n\\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\\n\\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don\\'t fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\\n\\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\\n\\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn\\'t be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\\n\\nThank you.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Don't get me wrong I love this Yu-Gi-Oh game, I have two separate accounts with non-meta fun decks to enjoy the games with. I run Toons (love Pegasus), Witchcrafter (fun, cool artwork, please limit grass is green, it's disgusting), and I used to run Blue eyes (love Kaiba). I could sit through my opponent summoning a thousand times, and still enjoy trying to struggle and battle my way to a possible win.\\n\\nHOWEVER, there are a couple of major problems: Herald and Drytons with their unlimited resource generation (thanks to Cyber Angel Benten and Eva, they're not banned or limited like in the TCG), and D.D. Dynamite bots.\\nYes you can still win against either but it comes down to are you lucky and do you get to go first? Is your deck made to go first? Is your deck built to specifically be able to counter these kinds of decks? If you're going up against a Herald and Drytons deck, can you play through a million omni-negates (meaning you don't get to do anything, try to activate any card it doesn't matter herald of Ultimateness or perfection will shut you down.)? You don't get to play, which honestly makes you question why am I playing this game?\\n\\nWith D.D. Dynamite if they go first and are able to get in whatever order Banquet of Millions and two D.D. Dynamites, once they activate the chain you're done it's over. The only way to counter this is to not have 15 cards in your extra deck, and the deck is so unbelievably toxic, people have BOTS going around and farming games for wins. And the bots are programmed to automatically surrender should they mess up the combo or cannot win. At that point it's honestly just annoying, yeah free win, but I would rather be facing an opponent and having a real challenge.\\n\\nThere's gotta be some balancing done, Master Duel has been known to be losing players even though so many have been excited about its release. I'd hate to see this game die out earlier than it needs to because I genuinely like playing it.\\n\\nAlso don't get me started on meta decks, to be honest I would love to just see more variety, like all I'll run into is Tri-bridage, or sky strikers, or like I mentioned above the beyond toxic decks. There could be a mode for those that want to have fun, I feel like that would push people to be more keen to not play for wins. Like I said I just want to see variety and I just want to duel for fun, not to win.\\nOther than that I love this game, really do. However the problems I have stated have sort've driven me away a little. Call me salty, or uncreative for not being able to deal with those decks (especially Herald), but I'mma be honest I'm just here for the fun. I have no meta decks and even if I do they have not seen the light of day ever since i made my fun fun decks like witchcrafter, silent swordsman, and a couple of others that are non-meta. I just wanna have fun :(\",\n",

       "  'review': \"As things stand today. I cannot recommend Master Duel. \\n\\nThe amount of gems (The paid currency) you get for free, when you first begin, is amazing, but unless you spend all the cards you get (Scrap them for their rarity based currency) and get the most META broken ass OP deck you can on the first deck you build. you will STRUGGLE to make any gems after that point.\\n\\nOnline matches suck ass. META decks are a constant everywhere, using more fun decks like Blue-Eyes or even your favorite characters deck from the anime will get you nowhere fast. And even if you DO somehow get a high rank. Doing so only harms the amount of gems you get, as when your rank resets you won't have as many ranks to grind through which means you will get less gems for way more effort. \\n\\nThe events, while being quite generous in the rewards earned, still aren't the greatest time. And outside of that you really only have story mode to play, which, while providing some cool lore based on the cards is still stale quickly and the time to gem ratio isn't worth it. \\n\\nYou can have some fun with friends if you all make 1 deck and duel each other, but eventually even that is ruined by it being an online based experience. Playing with buddies only makes you want to just go hang out irl with said buddies. Not continue playing this game.\\n\\nCheaters are another huge issue, forcing surrenders on turn 1 being the biggest one. No banlist and a complete lack of a casual queue really hurts this game way too much at this point. If you really like Yugioh, sure, you might have fun for a bit, otherwise id advise avoiding it like the plague until Konami fixes a lot of the issues and adds a lot more ways to play and earn gems (Buying them for the same amount if not more then real cards you can hold irl is idiotic).\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Master Duel is great. The music is especially top notch, and that alone is a huge plus for me. \\n\\nIt\\'s true to some extent that you\\'re going to see some duels that amount to \"I have about 6 negates, gone through half my deck, and have a full board\" after only turn 1. I also agree with the notion that perhaps the time limit is a tad high, but I don\\'t think it should be lowered by much if anything. But not all duels will be like that, and it\\'s likely best if you approach the game with an open mind, especially if you\\'re new. Solo Mode is a decent starting point to review the many types of decks you could face against.\\n\\nMaster Duel, much like Duel Links, is meant to be more like a journey. There\\'s going to be cards that you might think are downright bonkers. There\\'s going to be duels where you feel like you never played at all. But I imagine this is just the beginning for the game, and perhaps future features will add more dimensions to the game.\\n\\nIt\\'s going to be a little difficult to make more decks past one or two (if you plan to be F2P), so you will need to be somewhat decisive with your deck choice at first. The crafting system is a good feature, and I hope it doesn\\'t get worse later on. \\n\\nGenerally, it\\'s worth giving it a legitimate shot if you haven\\'t already.',\n",

       "  'review': 'The game is lacking in features, the \"ranking\" system is a joke, and the game is incredibly stingy. normal and rare cards are basically freely available, but at the same time these cards are entirely worthless in most decks that are even slightly viable. Acquiring super rare cards isn\\'t too bad, although that might only be in comparison to the ultra rare ones. There are several cards that are used in every single deck, and of course they are all ultra rare. The game itself is a pretty terrible time since most of the time it boils down to one side essentially playing solitaire for 10 minutes while the other either waits for their turn or surrenders. In a baffling decision, surrendering a game makes you receive no rewards for the match (I think it still gives you a tiny amount exp. The levels are basically meaningless though).\\n\\nYou are initially flooded with the gems used to buy packs, but this only seems like a generous amount at first. Realistically it is the bare minimum, if even that. After the initial amount of gems the game gets extremely stringy with gems. Even the login bonus decreases each day where in all other games I can think of it would increase, or at least not decrease. The drip feed of gems makes it impossible to try out different decks outside of those that are in the solo mode. The game has a huge variety of cards but that variety is entirely wasted by how incredibly stingy the game is.',\n",

       "  'review': 'As a complete beginner to Yu-Gi-Oh and after spending almost 12 hours with this game, I can confidently conclude that Yu-Gi-Oh sucks. The way card effects refer to and chain into other cards, which in turn chains again into other cards, means that you see a lot of those hyperbolical \"putting down the entire deck in one turn\" situations--summoning their strongest card(s) on turn 1 just because they can, making the game flow a complete mess; and with the inherent randomness of card games, if you can\\'t put down an equally strong field due to a bad hand, then you might as well not bother: the only way to recover is to wait a turn to draw, which means another turn for the opponent to strengthen their field and/or decimate you.\\n\\nHell, even if you do have the cards you need, who\\'s to say you can even use them? There are so many effect-negating cards in all shapes and sizes; monster effects, spells, traps, you name it, there are plenty of total shutdown effects in there, and they even come in a variety of wacky fun flavours: card destruction, banishment, return-to-hand, return-to-deck, or just straight vanilla negation, there\\'s something for everyone and they all taste like horse manure.\\n\\nOh yeah, traps--good lord, traps--they\\'re a gamble in which you don\\'t even know what you\\'re risking; opponent sets one down, and for all you know your next move, no matter how minor, could result in anything from you losing 1 LP and taking a gentle flick to the wrist, to having your entire field destroyed, half your LP taken, your credit card information stolen, and your Steam profile pic posted on the community board with a funny moustache drawn on it.\\n\\nWhy is this game so popular? Is it the catharsis players get out of going from being the dominated to being the dominator? From the bricked to the non-bricked? From the humble salty casual player who just wrote a negative review on Steam criticising the core gameplay elements to a filthy stinking meta slave? I may never know.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Definitely a good game. after all these years we have a game to play TCG online. side deck and best of 3 should be here but still everything is good. i also loved solo mode and generousity of the game. i think building a deck or acquiring cards are cheap with the help of crafting system. some people complaining about long duel turns or confusing meta decks but mate, come on, it is 2022 , which the hell of a thing is same as past in these days. i agree konami is not the best dev. to control that game but i think , we just need to accept the game as the way it is. if all decks or games are way too much quick or confusing for you, just catch it and be confusing ,be fast then if you still dont get enough joy so play with your community on the priv. rooms with old but gold decks. at the end just know that we all miss old days of yugioh. stay tipsy.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Don\\'t mistake my \"thumbs-up\" for whole-hearted praise of this game. Let me start by saying that Master Duel merely the \"new hotness\" when it comes to playing the YGO TCG on every platform. I assume older versions were fine, but the devs wanted to present the game with a fresh coat of paint and an excuse to update the monetization method. With that out of the way, Yu-Gi-Oh! is Yu-Gi-Oh! and that Yu-Gi-Oh! is still Yu-Gi-Oh! for some. So if I were to give my impressions of the game so far, then Master Duel probably lies somewhere between \"fine\" and \"good\" for the most part.\\n\\nHowever, for old school YGO \"boomers\" this game will be a rough nostalgia trip. Yu-Gi-Oh! is not the same TGC you remember. If you\\'re down with getting back into the game and learning \"modern\" YGO, then stick with Master Duel. If you\\'re looking for \"pure nostalgia,\" then you\\'re better off playing a friend with some classic decks or playing an old YGO video game from way back when...',\n",

It's as true as it gets to playing with the cards physically with the CURRENT game. Which is a very, very fast combo oriented game. If you're looking to play older style yugioh, this aint it.  If you're interested in playing yugioh but couldn't commit due to a lack of local scene or cost, this is an impressive entry point.\\n\\nMight change with time as the launch event ends, but a lot of the early currency is tied to the solo missions on the permanent account page rather then the limited time event. It might be a little harder and you'll have to nuke more cards to make a strong deck, but I can see this game allowing a new player to have a powerful deck within 5 hours at any stage in it's lifespan.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Let me just start by asking, for people who are comparing this game to YGOPro or Omega or other sims, what did you even expect Master Duel to be? It's obvious Konami isn't going to make a free official sim with entirely unlimited cards, like in what dimension was that an expectation on the table? I don't mean to be insulting but like, temper your expectations just a little, it was obvious from the start that this game is eSports YGO.\\n\\nSo this game is a 1:1 digital version of YGO basically, Konami has already stated they are going to be performing official events involving this version, and that this game is the official YGO digital version from now on, and they've clearly put a lot of time into this game. Being a free to play game, naturally you need money for boosters and such, but I'm actually pleasantly surprised by how good the card economy is, compared to the utter nightmare of Duel Links.\\n\\nFair warning, the banlist IS, PARTIALLY, based off the April OCG, as of April 2021, I'm assuming that was about when this game's development hit the stage where cards were being added, and BOY is it more OCG based. Can anyone else say Maxx C at 3 copies? I have no idea if Konami plans on integrating the TCG rules as a separate ladder or something, but I hope they do, however OCG is still balanced, just in a different way, burn and combo decks aren't well liked in the OCG, etc, and I have to wonder if Konami's finally thinking about a merged banlist or something, and this is phase 1 of that plan.\\n\\nThe boosters have a different rarity structure, with Rares being more common than one a pack, when they existed, SRs being random instead of one per pack, and URs being random but also lower than real life, where a UR is one every 5 packs or so, and there's no Secret Rare equivalent in this game. You can trade 3 cards of a rarity for any card of that same rarity, and a booster is worth about $2 each of in game currency, as opposed to $4 IRL. You also start with literally $140 of in game currency at what is nearly the start and the early challenges hand it out like candy.\\n\\n8 Cards a booster, and there's currently 3 25% off bundles of 10 boosters with a special card, and those special cards are all actually really good staple cards, at the moment, Ash Blossom, Solemn Judgement, and Lightning Storm. There's also structure decks that are 500 gems each, 1:1 in terms of gem per card, except you get one copy each of 40 different cards, which are mostly all good.\\n\\nThere's also a story mode, that unlocks special cards for playing it, and also ENTIRE DECKS of certain archetypes, like Gem-Knights, or the Demise/Ruin set. Some of these cards are pretty good, and it's nice to not even have to seek out Demise King of Armageddon, or many of the Gem Knight cards. It's also, and this is subjective, actually more fun to put in some amount of work to unlock all of these cards, even if it's just a bunch of AI duels.\\n\\nIn short, I'm pleasantly surprised at how reasonable this game's economy is compared to literally every other free to play card game, and I genuinely am going to play this game seriously. This game could be a great testing ground for new format ideas, should Konami decide to actually do that, and even without that possibility being considered, a very fun beginners platform for the game, and also potentially a cheaper way to play in official matches, without spending as much of a fortune on cards.\\n\\nEDIT: Yeah so now there's a fan sim that works literally as well, but it's unofficial and doesn't have event formats or a good solo mode, it's called YGO Omega, my old review still stands, but if you're on a budget, well lets just say if you're dueling friends, they'll get used to Omega pretty quickly. Also Konami needs to fix the bot problem, badly.\",\n",

Im mostly a F2P player. they do give a lot of gems so people trying to learn can build the decks they need. i made 2 tier 1 decks off of that alone. but those gems run out and there are no rewards for being good. there is no reason for me to grind the ladder and make top rank again cause i got nothing for it the first time. i put hours into this game between steam and my switch collectively around 120hrs. and i have nothing to show for it. the game is still super early so ill revisit this when i feel the game is going in a better direction but you are going to be sinking A LOT of money into the game after the gems dry up\",\n",

You can't enjoy what Yu-Gi-Oh really was unless you play customs with friends, or you get a few games in ranked in bronze where most of the decks are bad or normal. Legacy means nothing in this game, and you'll get a 1 and done vs new generations. They don't have it set up so you can go online and only play with decks of the same generation as yours, it's heavily unbalanced. \\n\\nBest part is, waiting 15 minutes for someone to finish their turn, its either they're using a BS Deck or they themselves barely know how to use it, they just copied someone and know it's OP and or Broken.\\n\\nGame could be amazing if they let people Duel in balance.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'A great game...so long as you say screw the meta, and try things outside of it.\\n\\nLike a lot of folks trying this game out, I too was a lapsed Yu-Gi-Oh! fan from back in the day. I find it this incredibly addicting and fun! \\n\\nThat said, YGO as a game has changed immensely in the past 15 or so years. There\\'s going to undoubtedly be new cards, new rules, new mechanics -- and for the most part, the new stuff is relatively straight forward. \\n\\nBut I do notice that some of my more engaging duels are actually ones where my opponent and I have these intense back-and-forth thrillers where we\\'re both not sure who is going to win. A lot of it comes down to the wire, and I genuinely enjoy that. (For context, I run a Ghostrick beatdown deck, it\\'s a very unconventional but fun deck). \\n\\nI know there\\'s going to be folks that want to build some sort of OTK deck with like 50 combo summonings and all, which is fine, but gosh there\\'s SO much more to this game when you got an evenly-matched opponent that can play and must try to out play. It\\'s definitely worth exploration too when the franchise has given folks THOUSANDS of cards to work with. \\n\\nTo kind of sum up my thoughts, will give some bullet points: \\n\\nPROS:\\n+ Pretty fun, exciting game play!\\n+ Lovely artwork, would like if more summoning animations for other cards.\\n+ Variety of cards with which to make different decks.\\n+ The Solo duels/modes have been quite enjoyable in artwork, lore, and music.\\n+ Cross-progression/cross-play is greatly enjoyed! I love being able to switch from PC to just lying in bed, playing on my Xbox. \\n\\nCONS: \\n- I think the amount of gems/crafting resources could be upped a little bit. Maybe not a one-for-one conversion, but I think two cards should be able to fetch you one, at the least, rather than 3.\\n- I know it\\'s coming, but I\\'m hoping an Exhibition mode is added soon (because trying to navigate current rooms to do Casual matches is a bit of a hassle right now -- a \"Quick Match\" option should have honestly launched Day 1 right along side Ranked). I think that\\'d be a great place to see a variety of decks rather than the currently heralded meta we\\'re seeing now in Ranked.',\n",

       "  'review': '[b]Yu-Gi-Oh! GO MASTER DUEL[/b] really really good! And most of all, fair even for ppl who cant really afford to spend in F2P (free-to-play) games. Not a perfect game, but a darn good one at that.\\n\\n\\n[b]PROS:[/b]\\n- Love 3~4 ARCHETYPES? You can MAKE THEM DECKS FOR FREE, VERY EASILY, with very little time investment. Get cards you hate/dont care about? You \"trash\" them (gives 1/3 of ressource needed to make one, ANY ONE, of a given rarity card). This means that they cant really lock hard to get cards behind paywall very well. THATS GOOD FOR POOR PEOPLE!! :D Very player-friendly. I only like a few archetypes myself. So when you get cards you dont care about; get loads of ressources for their sacrifices. In short its generous and very allowing. I wished F2P were more like that overall. \\n- One of the most generous F2P I\\'ve ever played with the currencies.\\n- LEARN TO PLAY! Summons/XYZ/SYNCHRO/Pendulums/LINK SUMMON! More possible tactics than ever before!\\n- Extremely large diversity of archetypes. All my favorites are there.\\n- INTUITIVE CONTROLS when playing with the mouse.\\n- I like the user interface!\\n- Some OSTs\\'s really good! \\n- MULTI-PLATFORM\\n\\n\\n[b]NEUTRAL[/b]\\n- Controller scheme is a little bit odd at first. \\n- Ranked \"META\" Tryhards. Meta is an inevitability (just read the discussion boards here, lol). BUT YOU DONT HAVE TO chase that unfun animal! They\\'ll instantly kill you turn 2 consistenly emptying their decks (in ranked) with pendulum/LINK spam. Yet... Because its RANKED... They\\'ll get pushed up and up into \\'META HELL.\\' Which is ALSO good for you... Please. Dont play cards because some ppl rank a/b/c card \\'better\\'. Yeah you might win more early but then youll get into cutthroat deck matches only, which isnt everyone\\'s cup of tea (ppl there end up playing a few selection of deck, usually). On my end, I dont use RAGEKI (yes - RAGEKI is given for free very early game - insane) for one; because it kinda pushes ppl towards homogenized decks by a notch. Two; nobody likes that damn cards. Three; doesnt fit the flavour of my decks. Play RANKED! :D Play naturally with your favorite archetype. Wanna go full meta tryhard to the maximum? Well dont complain the matches are unfun though. Its a self correcting problem. :3\\n- F0RTNITE PASS. Lol, this again... Pfft... Well its easy to gain ranks: Play ranked! :) You suck at YGO? Youll STILL gain in the \\'pass\\' and earn ressources for the cards you want! Its not \\'a drag\\' its reasonable in this game. Its not \\'feeling like work\\' unlike other games with that implemented.\\n- Got a \\'3D FIELD\\' custom style? You cant apply it uniformally to the opponent too... Which means if you have the default \\'green plains/ruins\\' (which looks fine) and your opponent plays with its \\'volcano\\' themed one it looks a bit weird clashing visually. That said they did that right - looks modular-esque (Hard to put into word) like a tabletop setup.\\n\\n\\n[b]CONS:[/b]\\n- NOT THAT MANY ACCESSORIES to unlock early (field pets/3D fields design/sleeves/avatars/description keywords/wallpapers). Thankfully we have the pretty ghost hand-trap as \"field pet\" to make the field more pretty (her name is Blossom something something, which escapes me atm. (If youre a \\'real yugioh fan\\' you know who she is and she\\'ll make you smile).\\n- CANNOT COMMUNICATE in match/outside matches. :/ Yep.. went the \\'safespace route\\' (\\'because it costs money to have moderation service and think of the chillens\\') So for all you know the system might plug you vs an AI in ranked/free play or not... Would allow ppl to connect and make more friends. I had a match with someone playing CYBER DRAGONS earlier, and it was really fair-balanced between the two of us. I cant communicate to the person. :/ I can only \\'follow\\'. Cant even find them on steam and talk there (steam doesnt record that as \\'playing with others\\' so no names recorded there to jump to their profile).\\n- CENSORSHIP OF CARD ART (again... WHY??) Of course, to appease journalists/soccermoms/SJWs/etc.\\n\\n\\n[b]CONCLUSION:[/b]\\nI love this game already. Its FAIR for common players of the game too (I feel). I would definitely recommend it to fans of the TCG (especially if you\\'re the kind to play kitchen counter/with friends from time to time IRL/online). I URGE you to look up (if new to MASTER DUEL\\'s economy), before spending gems, how the \"secret booster\" system works. Its simple, and its nice! In the spirit of free speech, as usual, will leave the comment on the review open for questions, comments (even if negative), etc.',\n",

The Tabletops you play on are nice, the OST for the game is not bad at all, definitely a game I don't mute while playing, and the story is simple. It's also pretty easy to get into the Multiplayer and start playing with other people, the single player is actually not a bad way to polish up if rusty, and....Yeah. the game is fun and enjoyable, and something any YGO player would likely enjoy.

       "  'review': '[h1]Finally a Card Game that people have been waiting for, HOWEVER[/h1]\\n\\nThis game gets crazy online and I\\'ve been playing Yu-Gi-Oh since 2002 while learning through the Meta for different formats and coming from various Yu-Gi-Oh games like Duel Links and Legacy of the Duelist this is a very good upgrade and I really enjoyed it.\\n\\n[b]Pros[/b]\\n-The Game is Free, my friends saw me playing this game and thought it was locked behind a price tag and we have a grand ol\\' time. Plus due to YCS being gone for like a year and Remote Duels to me was very lackluster, this is a better way for others to play the card game.\\n-The Graphics, like oh my god this is the best looking game I\\'ve seen so far and visually it\\'s really great.\\n-Everyone can Play the game, it has cross play from many platforms from the consoles, mobile is still not out yet from the time I wrote this but it\\'ll be a good addition, I think the PC Port is the best Version. [spoiler]If you have a PS4 or PS5 you can get 50 Legacy Packs for free if you\\'re a PS+ Member[/spoiler]\\n-Mostly every card is here, I know Spirit Elimination is gone, I would be impressed if that card was actually added in the game and the Devs actually coded it in, and since this is an online game it\\'ll get updated\\n-Data Transfer, if you have a Konami Account and gotten through this would be the best back up system to have if you\\'re going system to system.\\n\\n[b]Middle[/b]\\n-The Gems, yeah this game can tempt you on a Pay2Win Scale on purchasing things if you want to get more Cards and Cosmetics, at least they were generous on the amount that they gave you, when you start out. [strike]At least it\\'s not like MTGA with their High Paywall![/strike]\\n-The Crafting System, I personally like it because Duel Links doesn\\'t have any kind of that method and it\\'ll make Deck Building Easier, however you have to use 3 of the same rarity to make one card that you are looking for.\\n-Music, I really like the music but I really wish there was a music selection screen because I really enjoyed that Monarch Sound Track. It\\'s my jam~ Also there were some that were lackluster.\\n-Secret Packs, I have a love/hate relationship with this method because you\\'re supposed to buy something and hopefully by the luck you got the card for a specific theme you\\'re wanting to build which is great but, I hate that 24 Hour Time Limit!\\n-Friend Duels, I really liked that they made it but there is some things that they needed to clear out because it was a bit complex on the spectator side.\\n\\n[b]Cons[/b]\\n-Where\\'s the option where I can select the OCG Art? Like This is a Rated 13+ Game and people can definitely handle \"The Lost Art\" I never seen a kid interested in Yu-Gi-Oh before this is mainly played by Adults.\\n-The Forbidden/Limited List, this is a weird option for me to say but why are there cards that were banned in OCG/TCG at 1 right now? At least Mystic Mine is banned...\\n-Ranked Duels, it\\'s a huge curve ball to see people doing Meta Plays with people playing 25 Cards and I have to wait about 10 minutes just to wait for my turn. Then get Negated every time based on their plays. And the annoying thing I can\\'t surrender and go to the next game because I have to earn experience for my Rank, so better learn some suicide plays! Also this game\\'s ranking system is rewarding yes but the struggle with it is not fun, I really recommend an option for people to do casual duels as well that\\'s not on their friends list to make them understand the game a bit more.\\n-Card Activation Timings, okay this is a Pet Peeve of mine, I usually play Trap Cards that summon monster during opponent\\'s turns and it it always wanted me to play it during the Battle Phase, around the Damage Step or Effect Chains and I cannot activate it unless it prompt me up to Summon the Monster and I get a Missed Timing Activation Notice because my Monster\\'s Effect has \"When\" not \"If\" ! And most meta cards nowadays needed a lot of prompts in order to make their decks work!\\n\\nIn Summary, I really like this Game, I\\'ve been waiting since this game got announced and it has 2 delays while it was going to be released, what I\\'m wishing for is that they give out more better options on online duel play with random people then just only ranked plays, and more cosmetics, Bug Fixes, and many more! Really hoping for a Music Selection Option... I even told my friends to play it because it\\'s better then Duel Links based on the Shopping Mechanic and Functionality of this game. \\n\\nAlthough, it\\'s not really Casual Friendly due to the Meta that they gotta face through, I would recommend Duel Links to learn the game on a free easy approach then to Master Duel, or even Legacy of the Duelist since you only pay for the game itself and don\\'t have to buy additional cards with Micro Transactions with Gems, you earn the Cards by playing through the Game itself with it\\'s in game currency. And let\\'s see how the game can last to old players.\\n\\n7/10: It\\'s an Amazing Online Card Game but not perfect. It just needs some time.',\n",

       "  'review': 'So after months and months of showcasing this game with no release date, Konami just drops this on us out of no where like a penny being tossed off of a sky scrapper.\\n\\nI\\'ve been waiting for a game like this to finally exist.  It\\'s only been about half a decade since games like Hearthstone have came in and shown how successful a model like this can be, making it ever so perplexing as to why Konami seemed to insist that every one of their Yu-Gi-Oh sims had to adhere to the old model of a game releasing with the then card pool and never updating.  The last game, Legacy, was close to breaking that... but here we are now.\\n\\nAs a simulator, it\\'s perfectly functional.  Hard to mess that up.  The small, cosmetic things are a nice touch to really try and add something else.\\n\\nThere is a fairly decent Solo Mode featuring the storylines to various archetypes that\\'s nice.  You can earn a lot of gems and cards to get you started just going through that, and the decks you use are pre-built for that mode.\\n\\nI\\'ve been pleasantly surprised with just how F2P friendly it is out of the gate.  The closest endeavor we had seen before this was riddled with microtransactions and few ways to earn.  Solo covers this.  Playing Ranked also does a little.  Any and most cards you get have a crafting system that really just equals out to trading three cards for one.\\n\\nSpending gems on packs is a \"good enough\" value in that if you\\'re unlucky, the game guarantees a pull next time.\\n\\nCross platform, shared saves?  Future is now!\\n\\nThe one battle pass could do without a time limit.\\n\\nReally there\\'s just three immediate problems...\\n\\nGems may be given out a lot early, but this game is looking to make money.  It\\'s not just going to give you everything.  So eventually you\\'ll hit that curve.  The crafting system both helps and worsens this as you can just get what you want or need, but then you\\'ll be just as limited with your craft items as you are with gems.\\n\\nSecret packs are obviously to put pressure on someone to buy.  Limited for 24 hours, and only accessible whenever you craft SR+ or pull a card featured in that pack.  They\\'re also the only way to condense your card pool as there\\'s a limited ability to select your card pool otherwise, and even then half of the cards are still coming out from the larger card pool.  There\\'s no system in place that makes it so you can fix a little bit of what you want as much as it is all RNG all the time.  You\\'re more or less required to use the craft system if you ever intend on completing a deck.\\n\\nEven though a majority of players who are likely to play are TCG, this sim caters almost exclusively to OCG; Japan, Korea, etc.  This includes ban lists and rulings.  Card effects and workings.  YES!  OCG has some cards that aren\\'t just ruled differently, but play differently than its TCG counterpart.  I wouldn\\'t want this game to get region locked, but that\\'s also been a problem about Yu-Gi-Oh for ten years now.  It shows every World event when the top player there is playing a deck that\\'s not relevant to both TCG and OCG because of how Worlds has to combine the two massively different games with their own banlist.\\n\\nThat also leads me into another issue that has nothing to do with this sim...\\n\\nIt\\'s still Yu-Gi-Oh.  A game where it\\'d appear you can either play competitively or strictly casual.  I\\'m not going to be able to go in, play my goofy for fun deck, and expect to do much of anything.  There\\'s just a certain point that when you play for fun, you find yourself unable to even make a play against a deck that\\'s highly competitive.  I\\'ve had this conversation other places before with people just going \"why would you play to lose?\"  Well, you can just look at this review section and see that there\\'s more than just a few people who are trying to come in and are wanting a fun experience, only to just not get that, barring of course the people who just refuse to accept that the game has and should change.  It really sucks that, as of this time, the only real mode available is Ranked, where people are going to be expected to play competitive.  It sucks worse that as people invest into the now meta, it\\'s uncertain if they too will even be around in half a year when the meta shifts and you no longer have the sources to get those cards.  I do see Event Duels are planned for the future.  I just hope a half-decent PvE mode will be on offer, like Solo mode continuing to get more love, or this will just become a circle jerk that at the end of the day isn\\'t fun to constantly engage in; both because some PvE could help acquire gems and because it\\'d let someone take a break and play some kind of goofy deck.\\n\\nThe game is worth picking up now.  You can either just casually play and pick up things for when the game updates in the future, or really get into the competitive side of things out of the gate.  Eitherway, for the low cost of free, it\\'s a hard deal to beat',\n",

Summon this which lets me special summon this which effect means I can bring this back which means I can activate his effect that lets me draw 9 cards, then play this which lets me destroy everything and then bring back this which activates his effect which does this and lets me summon this, then I take your PIN number and put this in defence mode. Then I summon this which fucks your mum behind the bike sheds and does 15,000 life point damage but I negate it to activate this which summons this.\\n\\nI hope there's classic mode or something, blame my small brain.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'The children\\'s card game remastered, built to adhere to tournament rules and be a new spark in the YGO landscape outside of Duel Links. Overall, it is what it offers: A crisp and clean online CCG that faithfully recreates the experience of the Yu-Gi-Oh tabletop card game in the digital format, and is a good experience if that is what you are looking for.\\n\\nThere is a host of single-player content, from tutorials to introductions to decks and packs that you may never have got to experience before, mostly centred around a lot of the new content and certain gimmicks that can be employed by the decks you have a chance of winning if you manage to do so with resounding success. These decks are available to unlock just from playing the content, and remains free to play up to this point.\\n\\nYou can also construct custom decks or collect/buy gems in order to make pack purchases, which are going to be your primary source for obtaining new and sought after cards for the decks you intend to build. One feature that is employed in this game is dismantling - at an exchange rate equivalent of 3 dismantled cards to assemble 1 card of the same rarity tier - and will be your secondary source of obtaining cards ideally. If you are able and capable of committing to the game for an extended period across several weeks, you can maybe reasonably acquire decks you can build from and compete with among friends, and the simple method of following friends is easy enough that anyone can do it, and can even construct rooms if you have a group of friends that you have an interest in playing together with, utilising a spectator mode that allows you to watch each play from the beginning up until the moment that the duel is happening live if you happen to be late to the party.\\n\\nAnd that is about all the cushioning I can give you for this massive BUT incoming.\\n\\nBecause the online play in ranked is a complete nightmare. Either you\\'ve built an OTK deck designed to win the game from turn one or you\\'re one of the numerous others trying to get anywhere with whatever deck you\\'ve built or been given. The entire scene is riddled with all the current and up-to-date YGO cards, and that also means all the mechanics are in play as well, and given the extensive scene sustained in the YGO community, all those OTK builds are easily findable online but are also literally the only way to make any progress on any ranked level. If you\\'re looking to try and have a fun time, either you\\'re better off with friends or finding another game, because anyone not hardcore will either feel their soul leaving their body trying to meet any of the criteria for their missions as they slowly convert into using these OTK builds, or they quit.\\n\\nAh right...that\\'s the other thing. The missions. Konami have opted for a \"earn your free shit\" method of their monetisation, in the form of Missions and a Duel Pass. In order to make progress on the Duel Pass, you mostly just have to finish games: A loss will nudge the bar (expect a lot of those if you\\'re not following the above) and a win will set you up with a few levels at once. The rewards are meager overall, with capstones at 50 and 100. The real meat and potatoes, however, lies in the Missions. The timed Missions are essentially primers and small tasks you can conduct over the course of playing the game: Play a Ranked game, Destroy X amount of cards, play x amount of Solo content, login per day. That kind of thing. But it\\'s a good thing the unlimited sets are unlimited, because - once again - without an OTK deck, you\\'re very unlikely to be able or bothering with trying to achieve anything there with the amount of broken mechanics that are strangely \\'as intended\\' for the game meaning you could very well conduct a turn where absolutely nothing mattered. Oh, and did I say that all of the unlimited tasks (beyond ranking up your personal level) are basically only counted for in the Ranked mode? Because you can only make progress on them in the Ranked mode. Playing among friends, playing against the AI, NONE OF IT MATTERS. THERE IS ONLY RANKED.\\n\\nSo yeah...unless playing with friends or you enjoy the solo work, or you value the worth in building decks that eliminate any player urgency relating to being a friendly competitor on the other side of the screen, you will not have a fun time with this. You might get a bite of nostalgia here and there, you might find some of the challenges in solo play interesting and fun and you might have friends who can make the experience enjoyable just for a bit of a laugh around sometime. But if you want to do anything meaningful in this iteration of the game? You\\'re better off looking elsewhere. Ranked is an OTK hellscape that sees no signs of stopping, and this game is not worth your time if the best it can offer you is a labyrinth maze of frustration getting anywhere.',\n",

       "  'review': \"For the old timers coming back: \\n\\nThe yugioh paradigm has changed quite a lot so don't expect the same type of style of game from way back during the duelist kingdom and battle city era. It is a lot more complex at this point time, and unless you are willing to learn and not just nostalgia driven for only the nostalgia. There is potential the Event mode could bring back rule sets from way back as special modes but this is purely conjecture. \\n\\nFor newcomers: \\nGame is fun and the solo mode is a great way to learn the basics, rules and styles of strategies. Might seem a little daunting at first but if you stick with it you can start doing well and even build potential unique or meta decks. A video here or there watching other people play the game at meta can show you how complex the choice making in this game can be. \\nMost decks currently use are varied in archetype, but do not be surprised if waiting for your turn takes a while or the enemy might stop your plays. It's part of the game while you learn to counter such tactics and well the waiting can't really help you that. \\n\\nFor the yugioh fan keeping up with the game and overall look of the game:\\nThis game really is it. You'll love it and find it to be a pretty both artistically and musically as well. Animations are dope and having as many cards on here as it does, YOU WILL FIND A DECK YOU LOVE or at least you can make the one you want. Finally, the fact it cross saves between devices makes it great for maintaining progress on the go and ranking up. \\n\\nBANLIST. YES ITS THE OCG BAN LIST BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COULD CHANGE OVER TIME . PLUS IF YOU ARE JUST MAD YOU CAN'T PLAY DRAGOON COMMON. just use max c. \\n\\nGAME ECONOMY:\\nGEMS FOR DOING STUFF ARE FRONT LOADED. YOU WILL GET A BUNCH AND AFTER DOING ALL THE INTRO MISSIONS AND LOGIN INS, GEMS DRAMATICALLY DROP. YOU WILL GET ABOUT 2-3 DECKS DONE IF YOU SPEND WISELY AND USE THE SECRET PACKS.  AFTERWORDS ITS A BIT OF WORK, BUT THIS CAN ALSO POTENTIALLY CHANGE. youcouldaslomakeanotheraccounttomakeanother2-3deckslikethisandsaveittoanotherkomaniaccount. Season pass is relatively easy to level and is a great deal, you literally get your gems back and more. \\n\\naesthetic: 10/10\\nmusic: 9/10\\ngem economy: 7/10\\ncards: 10/10\\nconnectivity/smoothness in loading: 8.5/10 (game is a little wonky here and there)\\nF2P friendly: potentially\\n\\nPay 2 win: It technically is and isn't. If you pay and buy gems, you can push for creating decks faster sure. But eventually or with great luck (to speed up process) you can still make a good competitive deck regardless that demolishes. \\n\\nConcerns: \\nRanked rewards are minimum and should be fleshed out. \\nBasic modes for dueling. Definitely could use some sprucing up. \\nDon't know how free gems will change if at all after front loaded ones are acquired. \\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'On balance, I can\\'t recommend this game to anyone but die-hard YGO fans. And I\\'ll drop a few reasons for and against below.\\n\\nPROS:\\n\\n-Despite being an obvious gacha game, it is possible to get a full deck of whatever cards you want and a full set of cosmetics extremely easily if you are just a little bit clever with the crafting and dismantling system. I made a Deck of 50 cards (40 main, 10 extra) based on my IRL deck with just opening packs with the gems you get for doing solo fights against AI and dismantling everything else.\\n\\nI dunno if I just got lucky with unlocking new pack sets but I got what I needed in very short order. Figure out which packs hold most of the cards you want and spam open that til you run out and you are in all likelihood gonna be set with a full deck in about an hour.\\n\\n-Its free. Thus far I haven\\'t even discovered a page to pay money into this thing. I dunno how Konami is making that work but I applaud the clear amount of effort being put into the game regardless.\\n\\n-I like the idea of exploring the lore behind the archetypes while letting you explore them in greater detail.\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\n-The game is slow. Stupid slow. And part of that is the card game itself being full of what I will refer to as \"Solitaire Decks\" where you basically watch the other player play with themselves (double-meaning entirely intended) for incredibly long amounts of time, and you can\\'t do anything in the meantime so you just sit there staring at the screen.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t helped by the fact that there is a pause, possibly caused by latency, between each and every move, and certain parts hang on for just a little too long. As an experiment I timed how long it took for someone to do a turn on my phone and the final time was over 30 minutes long (30 minutes, 14.29 seconds to be exact). Half an Hour for this dude to do ONE turn, and by the end of it there are so many massively OP cards on the board you can\\'t do anything in return. Complaining about how they talk so long during the anime rings hollow when one turn is longer than an entire episode, just saying.\\n\\nAnother person just after this fight ragequit after I managed to get a single card effect off in the middle of his own Solitaire session, and not even an especially damning one. Sorry I interrupted your streak I guess but I\\'d like to actually play as well before I die of old age thanks.\\n\\n-Right after the tutorial it decided to download 6 GB of data out of nowhere, but because you can\\'t turn off sounds or do anything while that\\'s happening you likely didn\\'t turn off music beforehand, enjoy listening to that same 10 second snippet of bagpipe music over and over and over again for hours on end (On another note, why is a card game made in Japan originally basing its in-universe lore around Egyptian mythology using a short loop of what sounds like Cu Chulainn\\'s hiking music?)\\n\\nRight now unless you are seriously into YGO, or are in dire need of a sleeping aid, I can\\'t recommend it on balance. I may dive in if I\\'ve nothing else to do or if I wanna dunk on some kid or streamer with a copied meta deck as they desperately try to convince themselves they\\'re having fun as their life disintegrates around them. But if you\\'re not into that, I\\'d maybe keep a safe distance.',\n",

Turn 1, I played the one card I could and ended my turn within 5 seconds. Turn 2, the opponent proceeds to play cards for the next 3 minutes before hitting my face for 7000+ damage. The only monster I had played was sent to the graveyard for unclear reasons (the card descriptions are very complex).\\n\\nOn the flip side of that, I had a game where I got a Blue Eyes out turn 2 (my opponent's turn) and they surrendered turn 3.\\n\\nThose games don't feel great.

       "  'review': \"Now before you look at the Not Recommended that I have given the game, hear me out.\\n\\nI love this game, or rather I love what this game COULD become in the next couple of months.\\n\\nThere has clearly been love put into this product as it is leagues ahead of what the old Yugioh Online simulators were over a decade ago. It's fun to play (From an experienced player standpoint), has a good soundtrack and the interface for the most part is pretty decent.\\n\\nI like the idea of being able to craft cards for specific decks, even though crafting Ultra Rares is something you have to be damned sure about as there is limited in game currency for that. The initial gems are also very generous and I went above and beyond that by picking up the limited time purchases too as I felt they were reasonably priced. The regular price though is daylight robbery and you can almost legit buy real booster packs for the equivalent price they are asking. \\n\\nBy grinding through the solo mode stuff (Which only took me a day or so) you can come away with a decent amount of gems on top of what you get initially. From a new player perspective though, it's very easy to waste the gems on crap. Even as an experienced duelist I probably burned more than a few thousand gems on stuff I probably shouldn't have. I highly recommend watching guides on YouTube for what to spend your gems on so you don't leave yourself with a deck that can't win on the ranked ladder.\\n\\nNow we get to the real turd nugget about the game and the single reason that I am not recommending this game as it is now and that is the ranked system. At the moment it's super barebones as outside of friend duels, it's literally the only way you can PvP. I grinded to Platinum in the first couple of days and then because I didn't want to derank, I stopped playing ranked. This alone stopped me picking up gems from daily missions involving ranked duels. The big issue though is that there is literally no incentive to aim for the high tiers. There is no reward for hitting the top tier, in fact it puts you at a disadvantage compared to the people in tiers below you as the only way to earn gems in ranked is to level up a division/tier. So in essence people in lower tiers get more gems as they have more divisions to climb to the top. This advantage will only last until they hit Platinum rank where instead of getting a potential 2400+ Gems in a ranked month, they will only get something like 1000 which is only 10 packs!!\\n\\nGetting on to the pack system which is interesting but not a fun mechanic. You can unlock packs for a single day by pulling a Super or Ultra from that archetype in the main set which contains EVERY single card in the game. The other way being to craft a high rarity card from that set, the 24 hour availability still being in place if done that way. This incentivizes players to spend their gems quickly before the pack expires and essentially encourages whaling which I do not condone on a game like this.\\n\\nSo the game is fun, but the flaws do a lot to tip the scales the other way. The things I think need to change are:\\n\\n- The gems per day for login should be a steady 100 or so for each day on the game, not the miserable pittance the game offers after the initial flurry.\\n- Give ranked rewards, even if it's a mate or something. There has to be some reason to climb.\\n- At the end of the Season, you should be given the gem rewards for passing the tiers/divisions below. That way everyone gets the same if they climb all the way to Platinum 1.\\n- Secret Packs, should remain unlocked as soon as you have discovered them...or at least for a few weeks to give players time to rack gems up for that pack.\\n- We need more PvP options, make a free duel mode where you can match randomly for unranked games so you can play janky decks and not have to sweaty tryhard all the time. (This would benefit new players that are trying to return to the game and have no idea whats going on)\\n- Do something about Eldlich, in the high tiers, it's no fun for anyone being floodgated out of the game. \\n\\nThese are just my initial thoughts on how to make the game a better place.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"If you watched anime while you were a kid, you probably had a great childhood, but if you nostalgia kicked in and want to try what the same card game you were playing with your pals outside school looks like nowdays, you can forget you will find anything you are searching for in here. The game nowdays have over 10k cards, of which are about 5% relevant in current meta and you have to know each one of them if you want to have a chance climbing through the ladder. The game is not worth playing if you are new because of paywall. The game will massively award you for getting into, and with all currency the game gives you, you can craft a decent deck, but if you want to do something else, you will find paywall that makes game P2W. There are many YGO simulators on the internet that doesn't require any transactions so that's my complainment on paywall. Also, with this in mind, booster system is soo bad. You can get 1 pack and get half of the cards that are from other packs in that pack you bought. Story mode is kidna nice, you learn about archtypes and it helps you find archtype for your playstyle, but the challenge is almost irrelevant, so they overvalue deck you are giving to you in order to invest in it, just to recognize it's bad overall. Ranked system is fine.\\nOverall, if you are new or nostalgia player, better try games like Link Evolution that will get you through storyline and you will use decks that anime protagonists use in all series. If you are TCG player, well, you probably hate your life anyway, so who am I to stop you.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This seems like a pretty good implementation of a card game that absolutely sucks to play. I would recommend almost any other well-known TCG over this in terms of accessibility and diversity of play styles. If you're here because you're interested in learning a new collectible card game, my advice is to not bother. That's why I came here and... woof. No thank you. I've played Magic The Gathering for over 20 years and every joke about YGO cards having paragraphs and paragraphs of confusing conditionals on every single card seems to be hardly an exaggeration. And in the few dozen matches I played, every single viable deck seemed to be based around an absurd amount of recursive combos which made every turn a boggling mess. Imagine playing against the most annoying monoblue control combo deck you've ever seen in MTG, but somehow it's every deck.\\n\\nIf you're a Yu-Gi-Oh fan and you've been waiting for a Magic The Gathering Arena style implementation of your card game then you'll likely be very happy with this, though.\",\n",

However this doesn't even come close to what those old memories were like.\\n\\n-You will get bombarded with free gems and rewards the first days and thats about as far as rewards go. You won't earn anything apart from that. \\n\\n-Card packs are just expensive apart from that and the game is fueled by micro-transactions (which are overpriced go figure). \\n\\n-Ranked is absolutely awful, you will fight the same meta decks over and over and you will slowly mald while you see eldich or maxx c for the 25th time today. \\n\\n-Solo play is absolutely trash, you need to beat games with a trash deck, then go and beat them with your own crafted deck.\\n\\n-You will have infinite fun playing timelords, however you will be sad when you see all meta cards include things that directly counter timelords.\\n\\n-Turns in high rank take FOREVER \\n\\nThis game is missing alot of systems that would make casual play better. Do a No Mans Sky and come back in 10 years to enjoy this game\\n\\n\",\n",

Modern day Yu-Gi-Oh is more the issue rather than the game. If they implemented maybe a game mode that didn't have all the new stuff that has ruined the state of the game then it could actually be really good. Otherwise the game is draining, irritating and mostly boring. I will no doubt put more hours in but they won't be fun ones.\",\n",

(maxx c is not ok)\\n-Gems dry up fast, not letting you splurge on many different decks right out the gate.\\n\\nIt's an ok game. It's not a fully free duel sim as some people hoped. Play it with friends, or don't. Don't stress over ranked, it's a children's card game. If you want a complete, proper f2p duel sim experience with different formats/cards, custom duel settings and more, where you can fuck around with friends, play edopro, ygo omega, ygopro, or even dueling book.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This game is horrible cause Konami moment. Just play one of the fan made YuGiOh games cause the ban list in this game is confusing for almost anyone who actually plays YuGiOh. Also its hard to make many decks that you wanna use cause the gems dry up after a few days of starting and you have to gacha for cards. I am in plat and it is just full of Skill Drain, Timelord, and Chain burn. No one actually plays real decks and if they are, most likely they are using banned cards. It is fun below Plat I will say, I had way more matches against actual decks like Dragonmaid, Burning Abyss, Traptrix, Deskbots, and etc.\\n\\nEdit: I have been using more meta decks that I hate and I have been having a way better time, back to plat so thats cool. I just played against a @ignister player and I watched 3 videos while he played his turn, this is just ridiculous and now I wasted 30 mins in a game just to beat 1 player. Was not worth the win I'm gonna be honest.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'So, the game is generally fun to play, and if you *do not* meta hunt, you can make multiple decks for free, so that\\'s fun. Which is why I WANT to be able to recommend this game...but you\\'ve likely noticed I haven\\'t\\n\\nHere\\'s the problem: You are directly punished for increasing your rank. Detailed explanation below, but the short version is that you get the same gems per tier of rank no matter what tier you are in; you also flat out lose access to gems by being a higher rank, and gain NOTHING in return. So the higher your rank, the harder it is to get gems, and you have fewer gems to get. Until that changes, I can\\'t honestly recommend this to anyone that wants to actually try to win. So you know...to actually play the game. Because winning means you get less to play the game with.\\n\\nFor those that are interested or confused, this is how this \"lose to get gems\" thing has happened. Rank categories are Rookie > Bronze > Silver > Gold > Plat. Every category except Rookie goes from 5 to 1; so Silver 5 > Silver 4 > Silver 3 > ect. Every ranked season, you get gems for each rank you gain WHEN YOU GAIN IT. You get *nothing* for the fact that you have the rank during or after the season.  When the season ends, you are sent to the bottom of the category one below you. So if you are in Plat, you go to the bottom of Gold. You are not able to leave the top rank (Platinum) when you get, and you are also not able to leave the second rank (Gold) when you get that. The kicker here is that you flat out lose access to every tank-up reward below you. So if you are plat, and you get sent to Gold, then you CANNOT GET any of the gems for  Rookie through Silver that season. And you get nothing at all to replace it. Each category holds the same number of gems as well, so you get the same amount for going from Bronze 5 > Bronze 1 as you get for going from Gold 5 > Gold 1. So the higher category you are in, the less rewards available, and they are harder to get because you are playing higher ranks. Meaning, the correct choice is to avoid getting into a higher tier, because you lose access to money, and gain nothing in return. \\n',\n",

       "  'review': \"Modern Yu-Gi-Oh! is nothing but solitaire solo-play masturbation. 5+ minute turns that end in FTK unless you frontload your deck with handtraps. If you LOSE THE COINFLIP you lose the duel, it's that simple.\\nKonami released this without an event, full of bugs/glitchy menus.\\nBanlist makes no sense considering current meta (Infernities are limited and Spellbooks are forbidden while Tri-Brigade, Drytrons, Eldlich are all unlimited). A boomer card like Pot of Greed is banned but all t2 and above decks can mill and summon 7 extra deck monsters, dump 15-20 cards into the graveyard, replenish your hand, and setup the board with omni-negates and counter effects all for turn 1. When you consider how broken decks are and how they search 12+ cards in a single turn what's the problem with Pot of Greed? I agree it should be banned but that isn't the point. Pot of Greed ends with you as +1. Every t2 and above deck ends with you as +20. Banlist is a joke.\\nGems are frontloaded and they give you a 15-20k which dries up when you hit platinum. You have enough gems to build 2-3 decks at most and then you're stuck in gemlet hell. Paying and buying gems is lopsided with $80 only giving you 4950 gems which is only enough to hard guarantee 2 UR cards which are randomized. Additionally, crafting URs with this poorly thought out crafting system means you're dismantling 3 of your other URs for 1 UR card you need (and Konami decided to make URs extremely arbitrary and so most of the key cards for decks are classified as UR meaning you'll always have a UR shortage).\\nDuel Pass Gold rewards go up to level 100 and that sounds like a lot but in reality it takes ~2-3 days of casual gaming to max out the rewards. \\nDuel Pass Gold then lasts for ~70 days straight even though you finished the ladder in ~2-3 days.\\nAdditionally, Secret Packs are trash and expire after 24h so you have to constantly recraft SRs or URs to bring them back up. But worst of all you can't just BROWSE the secret packs and check out different archetypes to see if maybe you want to buy into Predaplants or Phantom Knights or whatever because it all disappears from your listings within 24h.\\nAlso the only packs that are up is the Master Pack which has all the cards in the game just tossed into it lazily, ok, but then we have Stalwart Force and Revival of Legends. Both of these packs are temporary and disappear from the shop after 60 days or so and will probably be hidden.\\nBasically, the way this game handles Packs and Boosters is a total joke. Keys/Secret Packs is one of the WORST mechanics I've ever seen in a game. And the Master Pack idea has to be the single most laziest way to handle boosters I've ever seen—konami can't be bothered to design unique and interesting booster pack ideas so they just toss every other card in the game into a single pack and call it a day. Piss off.\\nAlso for the last week after being post-content after hitting platinum I've only gotten ~50-100 gems, I've been stuck at around 400-500 gems for the last 4-5 days. Complete joke.\\n\\nYu-Gi-Oh! is a waste of time in the current meta. Just get better at flipping the coin and follow a flowchart with a top tier netdeck that plays the exact same end-game board every match.\\nOverall this is one of the most unpleasant experiences I've ever had in a game and a massive disappointment.\\nThis game ultimately gets a very generous 1/10 for me. Be grateful it isn't 0/10.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Master Duel is fine. At a technical level, the game's performance is adequate. Besides picture quality and multiplayer, Yu-Gi-Oh games have not change much since the first gameboy advanced games from the early 2000s. Master Duel is the same thing we've come to expect from a YGO game. \\n\\nI'm giving the game a thumbs down because it sucks from a player level. Master Duel is not for casual players. While the availability of thousands of different cards might sound thrilling at first, in reality, the plethora of cards is overwhelming. The first few times you'll play, you're going to get smoked by the same three meta decks over and over again. If you're like me, you'll stubbornly refuse to change the deck build that you busted out at the playground back in 2002. Or, if you're not like me, you'll eventually give in and go on the internet and find the meta deck construction and copy it. Whatever, that's fine if you're into that. But if you're like me, then you are more casual and you just want to build a Egyptian God Card deck to smack on some other dude's Toon World Deck (or vice versa). There need to be more options for the OGs.\\n\\nKonami should get rid of a lot of cards that allow for long combos. Sometimes a single turn will take 20 minutes because some dude special summons a monster and then synchro summons that monster into a tuner summon and then into a link summon back into a special summon. That's fine that the game allows for that, but in a computer game. where you dont want to spend 1 hour playing some card game on your computer, its annoying watching some dude do a million summons and take 30 minutes for one turn. \\n\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Master Duel is probably the best way to play duel monsters currently, and hopefully over time gets more QOL improvements, alternate duel options/rules & Events.\\n\\nHowever, the negative review is because the card game itself suffers a huge issue of meta spamming and has been subject to the rule of power creep over many years.\\n\\nDoes this mean I'm a sad bitter boomer longing for the days before endless XYZ, PoS Pendulum & lame Link summons? Most definitely... But I think it would be nice to have the option to be able to play old school decks and games, without being subjected to the latest Reddit or YGOPRO approved meta and tactics.\\n\\nAlternatively, if there was a way to region-lock [i]all[/i] Asian players to their side of the pond, then this game would be 10x more enjoyable for everyone else involved lol\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Yu-Gi-Oh Master duel is an alright game. It's fun to play but to play ranked duel is kind of boring. The reason why I said ranked duel in is boring is because the majority of the time you see the same deck over and over again. I think there are a few cards that should be banned from being played like ash blossom and many other cards. If these cards have gotten band. Then I think ranked duel would be much fun to play. The solo mode is a very fun thing to play because you get to try out a new deck without getting hurt by losing your rank. If I could change anything in this game it would be a better solo option like I would make a solo game like Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses or Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Duel Academy.  Then the solo would be amazing to play but for right now I give it a 4 out of 10. Overall I will kindly recommend this game but if you're not much of a competitor dueling then you're not going to like this game. I give this game a 5 out of 10.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"The monetization system and match-making trash the game.\\n\\n: EDIT :\\nAfter a bit more time with the game, I'm updating my experience and review. I'm still not putting it at a thumbs up, because literally the only reason I'm playing is because lolyugioh I just want to play in the major platform everyone else is in. However, I feel less negatively about the grind to make progress in the game. I'm not going to touch on Yugioh as a game in and of itself, it's Konami's responsibility to make this product -work- for the meta and expectations people need to meet to enjoy the game, which as it stands, this game doesn't. I'll be leaving suggestions for how to improve so this isn't just complaining.\\nThe primary issues are thus:\\nSettings are trash, no aspect ratio options and you can't even exit within the UI, you need to hit the Esc key, really basic QoL features that they lazily didn't consider.\\nGrinding for gems is a pain. 1 pack is 100 gems. Guaranteed SR card if you buy 10 packs, guaranteed UR if you buy 20, you can pick gems up in a breeze when there's an event but if you're grinding normal missions, expect it to take at least a week to get 2000 gems (or in other words, a week of grinding maybe 12-16 hours a week just to get at least one UR card). 1000 gems should guarantee me an UR. That's still ridiculous, but it's at least somewhat reasonable.\\nThe grind aspect of the game is ridiculous when considering you need hand traps to have a somewhat viable deck to even grind with and accumulate gems, and for a decent deck you're looking at at least 6-9 UR cards that aren't even structure deck focused, just generic hand traps. Let's say you don't pull them when you do find UR (you won't), then multiply that number by 3 because to craft one UR, you need to break down three others. That's 18 - 27 UR cards you need (JUST for hand traps, we're not even talking about other decent cards needed to run your deck like bosses or vital extra deck cards). Remember how much one guaranteed UR costs? 2000 gems. Now do the math. 36000 - 54000 gems JUST to get a decent set of hand traps.\\nNow here's the fun part. Now let's translate that into how much gems cost per $ value. A set of 4950 gems as of writing costs $79.99 USD. Plug in the numbers. In order to get a decent set of hand traps, if you decide to skip the grind and be a pay pig, is going to cost you ~$581.75 USD. For 6 hand traps. Now do you see why people have issues with this game?\\nThe one saving grace about all of this, is that you probably will get more UR's per pack of 10 than just one. But the reality is, you could be extremely unlucky like some people and face those kinds of numbers yourself.\\nSo, Konami has effectively built a game where there is a legitimate risk that you could need to spend almost half of a grand in order to enjoy this game at a basic level competitively. You could buy most top tier decks outright with that kind of money, like real, physical cards.\\nAnd there's an easy solution. Keep the crafting system, I guess, but allow people to at least pay -at a reasonable dollar amount-, staple, meta cards of the game that make it playable on a multiplayer format. It shouldn't cost over $20 to get these cards in-game. Either that or expand the single player content by a drastic margin.\\nThere's an even larger problem that affects Konami directly that they should address if they want me or most other people to spend money. The reality is, even though you could completely pay-pig your way through this, it's just not worth it. Remember how I said about 2k gems would take about 12 hours of grinding in a week? Okay, well 4k would be about 24 hours in 2 weeks. They're asking $80 for that. We'll remove 24 hours of grind, for $80, and there's just a -chance- you get what you need, a minute and slim chance but at least you can break down what you don't like, right?\\nWhat's your time worth? What is this game worth? Is it worth spending over $3 per hour to skip some grind so you can actually enjoy this game instead of losing constantly?\\nSpeaking of losing, there's five tiers of ranks in multiplayer. Rookie, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum. In Rookie, even losing advances you, so we're not going to legitimately count that as a rank. In bronze and silver, you can't lose your way to gold, but there are no penalties to losing, you don't drop rank for losing (at least that I've noticed). So, in practice, there are realistically two ranks that divide players. Gold and Platinum. This isn't enough separation to keep people engaged with others at their skill level. If you're Gold V, you're going to be matched against someone at Gold I. They will likely thrash you with completely kitted out meta decks, while you have maybe 2-3 hand traps and some staple extra deck monsters to get you by. This just isn't a workable system. This game has a large player base. Why are there not at least 4-5 degrees of separation from the very worst players to the very top? Is this just how the game is going to be, top tier players constantly being matched against non-competitive players who surrender before the full turn is even through? This isn't fun for either player, the loser or the winner. Just implement more ranks to separate people. Have better match-making. You don't even need to create new meta rules and ban lists, just let people engage with others at their skill level. This isn't a complicated problem.\\nThe cosmetics are few and far between and are pretty uninteresting. If they spent less time making up this ludicrous pay-to-win system and more time just making cosmetics and let players earn the cards on their own in reasonable, non-time consuming ways, I'd have actually thrown money at this game. I want to like this game. I want to give them money. But what do I get for it? $20 nets me close to about a 10 pack pull? I don't even get one guaranteed UR? For $20? Who is this game for? I don't care how rich I am, I'm never going to be able to justify spending $20 on a chance to get a card I probably won't even have a use for. This entire system fundamentally breaks the game in so many pivotal aspects that I can't recommend it. The game is fundamentally and completely broken by the issues listed above and if you're like me, you'll find yourself in a position where you're mostly just playing because you're just having fun learning about new aspects of Yugioh itself and you're hoping with time they fix it.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'It\\'s like this: the game isn\\'t the same as the World Championship games from the GBA and DS. It doesn\\'t have an actual story with characters or a world to explore or anything like that. It\\'s a Gacha game, albeit a less offensive one than most.\\n\\nMaster Duel is a free-to-play game. It\\'s got a Solo Mode that has some lore for the cards and a bunch of tutorials, and a \"Duel\" mode. In there, you can host some rooms and duel with friends, or play Ranked. However, unlike Duel Links (the other free-to-play YuGiOh game currently on Steam), which also has some Solo content and online duels, Master Duel has just about every card in the game implemented fully, including Link summons. It even uses a banlist that is very similar to the ones used for the OCG and TCG (the Asian and Western banlists respectively). This means that the archetypes that are in the Meta in the actual, real-life card game are pretty much the Meta in this game as well: Sky Strikers, Subterrors, etc.\\n\\nEditing decks is pretty simple, with a decent range of filters and tools to search for cards, and the interface for Dueling is very understandable. It takes a few notes from Hearthstone, with some items in the background you can interact with and ways you can drag your cards around the field to avoid some button presses and clicks. The duels in this game feel surprisingly good, better than Duel Links and even the World Championship games.\\n\\nYou can get Gems, the in-game currency, decently quickly at the beginning by doing some of the Solo mode and just trying a couple Ranked duels, and then get some card packs. You can also easily, and quickly, get rid of cards you don\\'t need and craft new ones to make the Deck you want. If you have a particular deck in mind, chances are you can make it here.\\n\\nSpeaking of the Solo mode, I think it\\'s just OK. It\\'s not great, I prefer being able to actually duel and re-fight NPCs with voices and different decks in Duel Links, and it has this weird system with Gates that you have to go back and unlock (which strikes me as padding), but otherwise, it\\'s serviceable.\\n\\nMy main issue with the game is that you start getting gems quite a bit more slowly after a couple hours, which makes getting card packs with their Super and Ultra Rares more difficult. You need these, even if they\\'re part of an archetype you don\\'t want to use, because you may have to dismantle them to craft another card you **actually** need. And, of course, as the names imply, those cards are pretty rare (shocking, I know). This is made a little worse by the fact that the card packs themselves are on a time-limit: after you unlock one (which you can do by crafting Super or Ultra Rares, or obtaining them from __other__ card packs), they stay on the shop for 24 hours. You can unlock them again after they disappear, but I\\'d prefer they just stay unlocked without the game expecting me to treat it like a job.\\n\\nStill, if you\\'re a person who enjoys YuGiOh a lot, especially the fast-paced version of the game played in tournaments today where Negates and chains of Special Summons are everything, and you don\\'t mind the Gacha aspect, then you\\'ll probably like this game a lot. If you liked the older YuGiOh more, though, with its more limited summons and slower game-play, you\\'re probably going to get smoked in Ranked and feel alienated. I\\'d advise you to either stay away, or only play the Solo mode until you get bored of it (the game\\'s free, after all).',\n",

       "  'review': \"All the negative reviews claiming pay2win have some merit, but are missing the bigger issues with the game. This is a card game after all, and money has translated directly to power in this genre long before Seto Kaiba drew his first card.\\n\\nThe real problem with Master Duel at the moment is the game is extremely grindy beyond your first one or two decks, all for an extremely barebones experience that doesn't offer anything unique vs. other ways to play Yugioh. As it stands, there are only 3 ways to actually play the game: solo, ranked, and duel rooms. Solo is neat, with little scenarios based around different archetype lore, but can be completed fairly quickly and is more of a one time distraction than anything you'll dedicate serious time to. Ranked is exactly what you'd expect and is the only way to grind the in game currency beyond the first couple days. Duel rooms are just lobbies where you can play friendly matches against friends or other players. \\n\\nUnlike Duel Links, there's no unique cardpool or ruleset. Unlike old single player Yugioh games, there's no lengthy campaign where you collect cards and fight progressively stronger NPCs, sometimes in unique scenarios. Unlike the unofficial simulators that exist out there, you have to spend significant time or money to try new cards and decks. And unlike the real life card game, you do not get to trade and collect physical items with real value (both monetary and emotional). The point is, while the game is a good technical foundation for (hopefully) future updates, there is very little reason to play it vs. other ways of experiencing Yugioh. Do not waste your time or money right now beyond the launch rewards. Wait and see if they turn the game into something worthwhile, because the potential is there, they just haven't fully realized it yet.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'This is the best Yu-G-Oh! game released in a long time, in my honest opinion.\\n\\nHowever, do your research before playing. Watch a YouTube video or two about how the game is played nowadays. It\\'s much, much faster than any old fan would think, and requires an entirely different set of knowledge and skills. The game isn\\'t braindead or easy at all, it\\'s simply different than the slow-paced Yu-Gi-Oh! of the past! Give it a shot. If you don\\'t like the long, complex turns and tons of summons, then the game simply isn\\'t for you. \\n\\nAs for Master Duel itself, it\\'s very generous with rewards for beginning players, and any player can make a competitive deck from the get-go with a couple hours of play. After that, gem acquisition isn\\'t bad. You get gems and cards with every win, and daily quests keep them coming. The concept of \"Secret Packs\" helps make archetypal decks, but they seem to be time-limited after you unlock them - which is done by pulling certain rarity cards of certain archetypes from the Master Packs - meaning that you need to take full advantage of them while they\\'re available. \\n\\nGameplay is veeeeery smooth, and it looks absolutely fantastic. Using cards feels great, certain big cards get awesome animated summonings that don\\'t take too long either. There are long turn timers, which can stretch out games unnecessarily, but also allow you to get a better grasp on the board state and learn what your opponent is really playing. !!READ THE CARDS. YOU WILL DO BETTER!!!\\n\\nSo far, there\\'s Duel Lobbies, Spectating, Ranked, and more formats to come, so those of you who don\\'t like any modern Yu-Gi-Oh! should keep your eyes peeled for that. Cosmetics look fantastic as well. Give it a shot, you have nothing to lose! If you reeeaaally like it, try visiting your local card store and seeing what events they have. :) Happy dueling!',\n",

       "  'review': \"Don't waste you're time and money with this game. I get card games can sometimes have repeat actions, multiple actions in one turn, ect. But that is all this game is. Most games seem to end in turns 2-4. Too many decks can have over 15 actions in the first and or second move with almost no negatives. Multiple 3000+ strength monsters and at least 1 negate down. If you've ever played Hearthstone and remember what the Jabawacky meta was like, that is literally this game, except on turn 1. Does all of this happen quickly though? No. For example, I just lost a game, on Turn 3 (Opponent goes first, makes 8 moves, has 3 traps and 1 2800/1000 monster; I go turn 2, 2 actions, 1 1900/0 monster, one trap; Turn three he goes, over 18 moves, board has 4 2800/1000 monsters, negated and killed my trap, spell killed my monster, and I lose) and this garbage barge of non-stop actions goes on for OVER 8 MINUTES. Eight minutes, for me to have 1 turn, and 2 actions. This is one example of dozens of similar matches and experiences.\\n\\nI've played MAYBE 5 people with reasonable non meta fun decks that don't make 28 million actions every turn. Compare that with the majority of the players having these win in turn 3 nonsense decks, it's outrageous, anti-fun, and AWFUL to experience. Save yourself the trouble, frustration and time. This doesn't include the 3 or so games where it's the last turn, I'm for sure dead (literally no cards on the field with less than 2000 HP, and the opponent has at least one 3000/2500 monster) and they decide, hey, I wasn't to still play solitaire, take another 5 mins, and 12 actions, to finally finish the game (Or like the one jackass I played who decide to end his turn rather than actually win). Can't just quit for event matches, or you get literally nothing. Sure, you can quit ranked matches, but does that even sound like a fun/worth while experience. If you are masochist, hate yourself, or enjoy wasting time, THEN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!\\n\\nIf you are any normal or sane person looking to have a game to have fun and kill time (enjoyably) then don't. Free is way over priced for the dun-heap of a game.\",\n",

This set introduced the Infernoids, a series of monsters that can special summon themselves to the field by banishing other Infernoid monsters from either the hand or the graveyard. Notable cards in this set include Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss, Qliphort Monolith, Uni-Zombie, Nephe Shaddoll Fusion and a card that would bolster Satellarknight to combat the Burning Abyss Shaddoll Meta, Stellarknight Constellar Diamond. In this series both Nyhmnim and myself will be opening 24 booster packs or one box of a core Yu-Gi-Oh! booster set. We will build a deck and play a best two out of three and the winner will receive a small price to upgrade their deck. However in each episode we will open another box of the next set that was released, moving in chronological order, constantly upgrading our decks before dueling each other at the end of each episode. This is the Yu-Gi-Oh! Progression Series.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Ill try to make a real review here, the TLDR here is that im completely neutral about this game.\\n\\nMaster Duel got a lot going for it, however one needs to understand what this game aims to be.\\nIf you are a competitive player and you think MD is the equivalent of other official TCG sims, you will be wrong.\\nIf you are casual and you think you can just hop on pvp and play with other casuals and nothing but, you will also be wrong.\\n\\nMD is its own thing, whenever you like it or not depends on your personal taste really.\\nIts like what LOTD ever wanted to be and more, if you are competitive its a great side thing to play if you gotten tired of the current format.\\nIf you are casual... well you might want to stick to low rating if you wish to have a fighting chance, but its still fun to play solo and with friends.\\n\\nSo to summarize, MD is its own game that uses Yu-Gi-Oh as its medium, its neither TCG nor OCG, it isnt competitive nor is it fully casual, i would recommend to try it out if what i said is acceptable to you.\\n\\nHere are some pros and cons:\\nPros:\\n- Great graphics and animations\\n- Pet system is cute\\n- You can get your cards relatively easy early on, can dismantle and craft specific cards\\n- Great soundtracks, coupled with a nice system that goes with it (albeit a bit flawed)\\n- Easy to understand UI and options\\n- Nice solo mode, where you can learn about the lore of the cards in Yu-Gi-Oh, though unfinished.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Best of 1 games, feels very luck based\\n- Missing cards, and a lot of them, also unreliable card addition to the game\\n- Very hard to get gems after the initial burst, many players make several accounts where each focuses on a specific deck.\\n- Ranked system is laughably bad - Very easy to climb to the top rank, rewards sucks and there arent even end of season rewards.\\n- Banlist is very iffy, some of it good , a lot of it bad (looking at you VFD and maxx C) honestly would just prefer if they put all cards in the game and use WCS banlist.\\n- For those that it matters the game uses OCG rulings.\\n- Gameplay is very slow, chaining animations are the worst offender. and on mobile and switch games, there is an extra lag added, even small combos can take up to 10 minutes, its bad experience for both of the players trust me.\\n\\nOne last note, for actual competitive players i recommend YGO Omega, a fan-made sim that support both OCG and TCG with rulings, banlists and cards pools with an actual ranking system.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I was there when the show took off. I bought the OG Yugi starter deck and duelled to glory with my Dark Magician. Oh boy has this game changed. In this iteration of the game the deck editor and thousands of cards make it almost impossible to find the cards you need. Need a card that sends monsters from the deck to the graveyard? Hope you know the exact name of the card you want because there's no way to filter that from the THOUSANDS of cards available. Lots of available cards isn't a bad thing, but it does make finding what you need very difficult. As far as duelling goes, A valid strategy seems to be boring your opponent to surrender. I'm already getting sick of sitting through 5 minute turns where the opponent plays through half their deck in the first turn magically summoning monster after monster. I'm officially declaring the Yugioh TCC broken. This game is also expensive. When I was young my mum hated the amount of money we spent of cardboard. I understand how she feels now and you don't even get the cardboard anymore. Forget Exodia, forget the Egyptian god cards, the most powerful card in this game is your credit card.\",\n",

You will sit there for 1 minute per each single card your opponent plays during their turn. To be clear I don't think it is people sitting there for a minute each card I think it has something to do with the servers and will probably go away in a couple updates. \\n\\nCard, they got a lot of them but I don't really play yugioh so I don't know if they have everything but they do have a fairly generous conversion process for cards. Three cards you don't want of a single rarity for 1 card of that rarity you want? Very nicely done, not that you really need to as the game is very generous with conversion currency. \\n\\nThe limited time packs you constantly get don't really make any sense to...but as you can convert and get any card (you don't even need a copy of the card to make it) it isn't an issue just seems like something fun they are doing.\\n\\nAlso there is a very long solo duel (you get very good rewards for doing this) but unless you know yugioh very well get ready to use a bunch of decks that you don't really have a clue.\",\n",

Master Duel as a simulator is fantastic. 10/10. But Konami has bogged down the game by overly implementing these horrendous anti-consumer mechanics of a gacha game. We deserve better, and until these problems are fixed, my review will be negative.\\n\\nUpdate: The game continues to be incredibly consumer unfriendly, and also has had a significant content drought. The game continues to be 3-4 sets behind the regular card game. The gem prices are still absurd and horribly made. This game was a banger, but such a flop now.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Being out of the Yugioh card game for so long (since before Xyz was implemented) and going into this, I do like how the UI is very simple and user friendly it is. Also I do love how the game walks you through the different major mechanics of the card game (like pendulum and linkz summoning) as that was some of the reasons why I left the game. Going back into Yugioh and seeing how easier it is for me to learn those mechanics made want to create some of the few deck archetypes (out of the zillions they have) like Blue Eyes or Egyptian Gods that I was interested in. \\n\\nAlthough does not make it any easier to read all the text, learn all the card interactions, and learn the many many cards that this game has, but I'm willing to learn.\\n\\nOne other minor grip about this game is that while in other card games, you can disassemble your cards in your collection and then collect some kind of material to then create another needed card. In this game though, the material you collect can only create other cards of the same rarity. Example: you take apart bunch of rare cards to get rare material but cannot use that rare material to create UR rarity cards. It'll take some time to get all the needed SR and UR cards through dueling, but if you're impatient enough, I guess the game has to make money somehow right?\\n\\nSo yea good game.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This game has gacha and p2w. That's just the standard for f2p CCGs, really, so I can't blame them, but it's definitely in there. If you're at all familiar with the collection and crafting systems of MTGA and Hearthstone, know that I would rate the f2p friendliness of this below MTGA but above Hearthstone (not that that latter one is saying much).\\n\\nAs far as Yugioh itself? It can be both great and terrible. I would say that as a CCG, out of the ones I've played (MtG, Yugioh, Hearthstone) it has the greatest potential for moments where a great topdeck allows you to do something really cool, where a duel can be a back and forth that feels like it truly wasn't over until the very last card was played.\\n\\nIt also has the greatest potential for moments that can be extremely frustrating, as your opponent sets up what is essentially an unbeatable board before you've even taken a turn. I enjoy it, but I also understand very well the reasons people would hate it.\\n\\nFinally, if you already play Yugioh regularly and simply want to know: Is this, finally, a good online matchmaking client? Is it fun and easy to play Yugioh with other people on this? Yes, it is. But it will likely bust your wallet every bit as bad as paper does.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'If you like eating while gaming, watching netflix/youtube, maybe some twitch, trust me you\\'ll have so much time to do in your enemies round. \\n\\nYou can also hit up the gym, shower, eat and come back if they are playing Sky striker, or some shitty Exodia card fetching deck. (Pray to god he gets full Exodia quickly)\\n\\nEither you have a good hand, or you lose. (Usually games don\\'t go beyond 2 turns)\\nYou\\'ll be bricked at turn 1 many many times. You will  spend 30 minutes watching a guy special summon 40 monsters to end up on a monster who\\'s effect is literally \"you can\\'t play anything, fuck you\" \\n\\nI understand the game is free to play,  but the way the system is made is absolute garbage. \\n\\nYou get a shit ton of gems, as soon as you get in, if you know what you\\'re doing, you might be able to build 1/2 meta decks or some fun decks you like using. \\n\\nIf you don\\'t know what you\\'re doing, lol good luck. \\n\\nThe more you play the less rewarded you are. (I can\\'t grasp my mind around this one)\\n\\nAll cards are behind packs, which only appear when you craft/pull an UR card of said pack.\\n\\nWhich means, when you get to the point of not being able to craft UR cards (After 1 or 2  decks), you\\'ll need to waste your already scarce Gems in Master packs, AND HOPE that your UR comes out, OR you pull an UR of the pack that you need..  (did I mention that these packs disappear in 24 hours? you either get everything you need in those 24 hours, or you\\'ll have to repeat the process again.)\\n\\nAlso yea the Master Pack includes all fucking cards so good luck getting that card you need. \\n\\nNow, I understand the game is free to play but the Gem prices are absolutely ridiculous, and they \"fake you out\" with these \"Gem promotions\" where even then, you don\\'t get decent deal. You get a shittier deal out of  all the other even shittier deals. \\n\\nThis game has barely any Banned cards. So, yea the meta is absolute nuts. \\n\\nNow, with all this said.. I love yu gi oh  and It was hell a fun coming back to the game after all these years, I  had a lot of fun playing Master duel on the beggining, after a while it got old. One turn losses. Not even being able to play before you 1st turn, god broken cards being played left and right. \\n\\nAbsolute cash grab with insane prices. (at the time of making this review 11.99€ will give you 680 gems which is equal to buying 6 booster packs and you don\\'t even get to choose which pack to buy, you\\'ll have to go trough the process I explained before) and don\\'t even compare it with real life prices, this is a fucking DIGITAL card game. You don\\'t have any manufacturing costs. \\n\\nThe game\\'s content release is REALLY REALLY slow. the events are.. meh.. \\n\\nIt\\'s a good game to come back once in a while to get that yu gi oh itch out of your system. \\n\\nIs it an actual cool engaging yu gi oh card game? Not so much.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I have played mostly all Yu-Gi-Oh Games and I still play Duel Links every now and then. I was looking forward to this. Surprisingly they are giving away a lot of gems and much better way of getting cards that you want compared to duel links, I haven't seen any reason to spend much on this, this makes it sound really nice but sadly... it really hasn't been pleasant experience or me. I have done like 7 ranked matches so far and 3 of those somehow took over 30 mins and the last match that I just did someone seemed to have a loophole deck that let him continue send to graveyard, add to deck, add to hand, special summon  and so on for over 35 mins, and yeah that's it for me, not trying again for a while. (Edit: Even when you don't get to face such people, it it will take insanely long for your opponent to finish a single turn, I tried getting into it again but unfortunately it is way way way too damn annoying when you have to wait for like 30-50 minute on your opponents 1 turn and that 1 turn will 99% decide the match. Really unplayable imo, had to start watching some yt in background to just get through without falling asleep. Surrender doesn't give any rewards and your odds of running into such long games are really high. I will probably go play my favorite Yu gi oh tag force again.) In Short, Stay away unless you are prepared to wait for at least 30 minute for each turn.\",\n",

But here is the thing that I just playing this game entirely in my match for WAITING the turn of my opponent and second turn I played my cards just to be negated by them.  Im giving this game a dislike for now until I hope someday the dev care about how originally Yu Gi Oh been created and made some mode with specific playstyle which the player want to be in the game.

Basically all I did in my 9 hours of playing this game was winning or losing when we were only at turn 3 or 4 of the game, because the cards are so broken at this point that you can summon the most powerful monsters right at turn 1, and decide the outcome of the game by just how lucky you were on the first 6-7 cards you drew. \\nThis is the worst experience I've ever had in a card game, and I'm so sorry for this because this game will live forever in my childhood memories for how much I loved it.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'It\\'s modern YGO, which is incredibly fun. However, Master Duel has some seriously underused potential.\\n\\nThe Pros:\\n* Surprisingly F2P, the amount of gems you get for playing for the first ~20 or so hours is incredibly good, \\n   and events hand out plently of gems.\\n* Presentation is fairly good:\\n\\t* Most UR monsters have a summoning \"animation\".\\n\\t* BGM is really good.\\n\\t* Some of the mates (think Runeterra\\'s guardians) are pretty appealing.\\n* The rookie rank is great for returning players to face other returning players.\\n* Secret packs aren\\'t perfect, but being able to buy your favourite archetype from one pack is quite good (not applicable to \\n   all archetypes, but most).\\n\\nThe Cons:\\n* No Bo3 Ladder. A big deal when the game itself is played bo3 at events.\\n* No casual matches. \\n\\t* Duel rooms technically solve this problem, but they are not as \"click button for game\" as they could be.\\n\\t* Fortunately ranked ladder isn\\'t completely full of meta (see: any reddit post for tracked games), but this could \\n           change.\\n* Lack of alternative format support. Why was the N/R format not a mainstay banlist in duel rooms?\\n* The game is missing cosmetics that really should be here.\\n\\tFor example (siderant):\\n\\t* A regular car? Why not Cardcar D?\\n\\t* Why are there so many regular objects as mates? As of this review\\'s posting, there is boxing gloves, a soccer ball, a \\n           basketball, a rugby ball, a crown, a chest, and a record player? Feels like they threw in unused Unity assets.\\n\\t* Surprising cosmetics are missing. We could use something like BEWD or Toon BEWD, etc.\\n\\t* For the \"low effort\" cosmetics, there should be way more. Profile icons ultimately seem to be cropped art, there \\n           should be WAY more of them. More card sleeves should also be a thing.\\n* Master Duel is currently behind the OCG by about a yearish (not really the worst thing, but...)(correct me if I\\'m wrong, I \\n   don\\'t really think I got this right based on 2 minutes of skimming).\\n* Despite being a digital platform and a live-service game, updates/new content is slow as shit. Compare to something like \\n   Hearthstone, that constantly gets cosmetics, cards, and more.\\n* Money-to-gem conversion is not worth it past the special bundles that may/may not be available anymore.\\n* The tutorial could be a little better to introducing the player into modern YGO (the amount of yugiboomers that become \\n   card game experts after playing against a compentently built deck made after 2014 could be lower).\\n\\nConclusion:\\n* If you are a returning player, I would recommend this over an unofficial simulator, as it\\'s free and you will be facing \\n   players of your skill level for the most part.\\n* If you are a current player, you probably already have an unofficial simulator downloaded, but I would still recommend \\n   this because the presentation really does make the game funner.\\n\\n(If I missed anything worth mentioning, let me know).',\n",

       "  'review': \"It's Yu-Gi-Oh!, warts and all. But as much as I can wax poetic about the game, I'd rather talk about Master Duel as a client itself, as it has been YEARS since the last official online client for Yu-Gi-Oh!, in case people forgot about Yu-Gi-Oh! Online.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Relatively friendly for a new player to cobble together a deck of their favorites, or a meta deck for rank climbing.\\n- Pretty decent rate of QoL changes as Konami updates the game every season or event to have a better experience. (For now, will be updated depending on how Konami goes\\n- The client has pretty great animation and music, as well as punchy sound effects to accentuate your actions in a duel.\\n\\nNeutral:\\n- Banlist being OCG oriented more than TCG, this can be great or bad depending on how you play the game itself. This means that those coming from TCG will be blindsided by how OCG is more lax with their banlist, leading to either crazy off-meta decks or really overbearing actual meta decks compared to the more curated decks of TCG format.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Money to Gem rate is atrocious. (It still, however, is cheaper than the physical game, which is saying something)\\n- PvP oriented. While there are AI duelist, and some with a pretty high difficulty actually, PvE is not how you earn a chunk of your monthly gems.\\n- Slow banlist updates. As of this moment, it has been almost 3 months since the release, and there has been no banlist changes at all.\\n- Hands-off tutorial. The tutorial and solo mode, while pretty lengthy and serves as a decent introduction to the basics, immediately dumps you off into the wild west upon completion, leaving players to have to either figure out what deck to make or sink immediately. This makes the barrier of entry to the game still high.\\n\\nOverall, it's a decent OFFICIAL client for Yu-Gi-Oh, for what it's worth. While there might be better options there right now, having an officially supported online client is also important considering other physical card games have been toying with going digital as well.\",\n",

       "  'review': '‘Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel’ is a fun game to play and a great time passer, it really helps new players learn the game with solo and has many helpful prompts mid-game.\\nThis game also has its downsides though, such as.\\n•\\tCurrency/Rewards: The game makes it out as though it is generous with rewards and gems in the first week (or less) but then has a massive drop in rewards making it very difficult to be able to create new decks to play. Because of this the game tries to make you resort to buying gems in the shop which are stupidly expensive. Adding on to this it makes playing this game essentially a ‘pay -to-win’ game.\\n•\\tBan-list: Master Duel is in dire need of updating the ban-list to make ranked matches better and more fun, you will come across many “meta” decks in ranked that are full of TCG banned cards which makes deck stupidly over-powered and makes duels unfun to play (especially if you have to spend 5-mins waiting for your turn).\\n•\\tCasual Play: Master Duel needs a game mode that isn’t ranked so people can try out new decks without having to either use ranked, and risk losing tiers/rank or play against a bot in solo.\\n•\\tRank Rewards: The rewards you receive in ranked are very disappointing, you only get 100 gems per tier you climb or 200 gems per rank you go up, all one-time rewards. Meaning you gain a lot quickly but then northing, plus its very disappointing receiving the same number of gems when you are in the higher ranks as when you were in the lower, making it feel less of an achievement.\\n•\\tPlay Information: (This one isn’t much of an issue, but I would love if it was improved). While in the duel there is a button the allows you to review moves that were made which is helpful at time and a nice feature, but at times you may try to cause an effect but then it gets negated leaving you to wonder how, and if you check the play log, a lot of the time it won’t tell you why it happened.\\nOverall, I do enjoy playing this game, but it has a lot to improve upon.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'Yu Gi Oh may not be the game it once was but if you can get through the sheer absurdity of what you can do with card combos then it can be pretty fun at times. Although the problem is that there is a massive divide between the playerbase as most people getting into MasterDuel are mainly newbies who have never played the TCG or OCG, thus meta decks run rampant around leaving casual players a bit stumped with sub optimal decks that they probably adapted from the anime or their youth. With such a high skill ceiling and with a pretty much non existent ban list currently (it does exist but some cards should stay banned for a reason) it can turn away quite a few people. Thus the problem about the Master Duel from a few players i know that got into the game are due to the actual card game itself.\\n\\n[b] Back on track to the actual game[/b]\\nThe game is actually pretty decent as simulators go. It\\'s definitely prettier than the \"unofficial\" simulators (e.g ygopro/edopro) with very good animations and visual effects to boot. The music in this game actually surprisingly slaps hard and i found myself enjoying the soundtrack quite a bit. Overall this game is actually pretty good but it\\'s held down by some crippling flaws.\\n\\nThe main issue i have with the game is the front heavy load of gems. As you keep playing you are mainly rewarded less to play and doesn\\'t give too much incentive to do so. The battlepass and mission system you burn through so fast that after a few hours you are committed to the decks you have made from the card packs you drew. For new players could get overwhelmed by the sudden surge of gems only to make some questionable purchases to make a deck that is well... less than desirable and find themselves locked into it. Granted there is a dust system so you could make another one but thats one less deck you get to play and part of the amazing thing about yu-gi-oh is the variety of archetypes that you can play.\\n\\nWith only the ranked queue that only gives mission rewards (solo missions are quite limited so far but give a nice boost) people are inclined to make the most relevant decks and thus not a lot of variety can be found* (granted this is probably more of a problem with the actual card game itself).\\n\\n*Konami addressed this in a post and has made plans to increase the variety of tournaments, how they will distribute rewards and deck variety will remain unknown for now.\\n\\nThe last complaint is one i have shared with most of the players and is probably ingrained forever within yu-gi-oh. Games can last from 1-5 turns.... how? Well you simply have turns that take 10-15 minutes long, Yu-Gi-Oh is awfully notorious for having long winded combos, however those combos are very slow in simulators (speaking from experience in edopro) and the turn timers are extended for every card you play so you can have turns that take a while. (Although for the increased turn timers actually might be a blessing in disguise as cards usually have about a paragraph of text to read, and part of the skill is understanding what each archetype excels at, e,g Sky Striker being a spell heavy deck).\\n\\nOther than that it is still quite a good game if you can get over the massive ingrained flaws, there is a reason why this card game is still around today. However, it is not the game that you might remember if you are a returning/ new player.\\n\\nOverall i do give it a good review as most of these issues can be fixed with maybe tournaments that host certain restrictions for decks and might turn into a fun casual game. Konami has surprisingly been addressing the community about their concerns and it will be interesting on where they will go from here. I wish this game the best of the best as Yu-Gi-Oh is something that defined my childhood and i wish it the best success!\\n\\nOverall for the game itself: 7/10 (would give it a 8 but the game of Yu-Gi-Oh itself is kinda holding it down)\\n\\n',\n",

It's not bad, but with everything it's intending I don't see myself playing this anywhere near as long as the Legacy of the Duelist titles. \\n\\nBeing free to play, I can see why the grind for currency and cards is much more severe in trying to prompt a payment, but there are a lot of insidious psychological tactics at play. Also, due to Konami's history, I refuse to give them any money if I can avoid it.\\n\\nThe tutorials are adequate, but the single player campaign is incredibly aggravating when using the decks that the game makes you use. \\n\\nThis game's ultimate intention is to get you into the multiplayer, and I am a casual play lover. After a while, any deck I would play with because I think it's fun gets trounced by meta level decks. If you love trying to make a deck that is at maximum effectiveness then you may enjoy yourself. However, I play decks I like for fun, and I choose decks I like strictly because of artwork, or stories I make in my head. I did multiplayer for a bit, but once I hit gold I never won another match.\\n\\nLastly, there is a significant lack of engagement when your opponent is having their turn, and I've surrendered because I've gotten bored or impatient when they take several minutes for a turn, or take WAY to long to make a decision.\\n\\nThis game definitely isn't the worst thing, especially with Konami's recent track record, but I'm probably done with this one.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"While being extremely FTP friendly this game sadly lacks quite a bit in A LOT of other gameplay aspects. It seems Konami has sort of picked and pulled certain cards out of some archetypes of cards but not others. Tri-Brigade, Sky Striker, Dryton, Blue-Eyes, and DM cores are quite polished only missing maybe two or three core cards for power scaling. While other less played decks like six samurai, underworld, utopia, are missing SOME SERIOUS  support cards when it comes to control especially in the recent meta. \\n\\nAnother major problem is the time of the matches, while most games are pretty casual in ranked, If I see Tri-Brigade, Sky Striker, or any sort of long form combo deck I scoop on the spot, because I'm not trying to play a two hour game of yugioh. The animations take way too long, when selecting certain actions within your turn do not penalize you for time, resulting in 15-25 min. turns in some cases.\\n\\nRanked is extremely strange with how it picks your matches. One match ill be up against a teir 0 deck the next I'll be facing some weirdly built synchro deck from 2012. The consistency is terrible.\",\n",

You'll be sitting there for 15 minutes waiting to take your turn then you finally get going placing some cards THEN YOU HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER 15 MINUTES TO SEE IF THEY WANT TO ACTIVATE AN EFFECT OR NOT. this wouldnt be so bad if there was a way to communicate against your opponent, if i could just be like hey i have 5 minutes left on my lunch break and would like to squeeze this game out real quick BUT NO I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THEM TO READ THEIR FUCKING 100000000th SKYSTRIKER CARD shits wacc ass\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[b]The definitive and comfiest way to play Yu-Gi-Oh![/b] (legally) \\nMaster Duel is incredibly fun and I recommend it to both newcomers, returnees or competitive players alike. As a returnee, I'm already enjoying this game more than I thought I would. However, I'd like to address some points other reviews have pointed out about the game. \\n\\n[h1]Is the game P2W? How is the Monetisation?[/h1]\\nIn terms of monetisation, this game is fine because I've already built two competitive decks F2P so it's pretty chill on the microtransactions. The premium battle pass is also f2p purchasable and can be completed in a day or two if you go hard. This is so much better than actual yugioh where you're paying $100+ for one deck that gets wiped the moment you drive out to a local by a player you're lucky if they've taken a shower. You just need to remember to be careful to not buy too many packs for a deck you want and just start crafting hard to get URs and SRs instead. \\n\\n[h1]Keeping up with modern yugioh[/h1]\\nA lot of oldschool playground yugioh fans will be upset that their childhood nostalgia blue eyes decks aren't cutting it in the modern yugioh meta. As an OG yugioh player who played the TCG the day it launched but hasn't played yugioh in ten years, it was not difficult at all to learn some modern archetypes and practiced playing them in master duel. I also find current yugioh more fun than how it played ten years ago. If you're an oldhead just like me, try googling and building virtual worlds, prank kids, tri-brigade, shaddoll dogmatika or even sky strikers and have a go at learning how they play against the AI. You'll stand a much better chance in ranked than using your childhood nostalgia deck.\\n\\n[h1] The game is slow[/h1]\\nYeah, I can't really defend this one. The timer is nice but a lot of new/average players (and even some decent) players will spend some time thinking as they make their plays and reading up on card effects. Actual yugioh in locals can play this slowly too but the plus side is, you don't ever have to worry about someone making illegal plays and arguing about it with the opponent.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This game is great in theory, but it has a really big problem. After about only 3-4 hours, you'll effectively finish everything this game has to offer, unless you want to jump into the ranked pit with all the sweaty tryhards. If you have a life elsewhere and don't feel like you have something to prove, this game offers nothing beyond completing some basic PVE content and building a deck.\\n\\n1. The PVE content is far too basic, it basically boils down to several tutorials for deck archetypes and if you build an even remotely functional deck you'll slaughter anything they offer you. \\n2. It's far too easy to get an amazing meta deck. In only 4 hours, I finished an extremely strong meta deck and proceeded to go 3/3 on first day ranked. (Against some good decks too!)\\n\\nFunctionally, modern Yu-Gi-Oh kinda fails as a PVP game. Card effects are too complicated, too frequent and turns take too long. It's not fun reading and keeping track of all the cards you've never seen before that your opponent is using. Additionally, it feels extremely awkward to spend two minutes summoning endless cards and looping deck combos while your opponent sits there twiddling their thumbs. It makes you feel like a bit of a jerk and it's not fun for either player honestly. I mean the timer for this game starts at like 480 seconds; modern Yu-Gi-Oh just isn't that fun to play vs strangers.\\nPVE however, could have been the perfect time for this format to shine. A gradually climb in difficulty while you get new and improved cards to tailor and improve your deck to rise to whatever challenges appear could have really made this game into a unique Yu-Gi-Oh experience.\\nWhat we ended up getting was just an excellent dueling simulator, but I'd argue that its only value is in dueling with friends.  And yeah, it's so easy to get all the cards you could possibly need for free, that this game is actually an alternative to playing Yu-Gi-Oh IRL. Get two people with this game on your phones, and why would you ever play physical Yu-Gi-Oh again? It's cheaper, there are less rule issues, and it looks and sounds great.\\nI guess in a way the game sacrifices a potential wider appeal by enabling its most hardcore fanbase. I genuinely think Konami were accidentally too generous with this game, and are going to begin dialing it back rapidly. \\n\\nWhat would really improve this game would be the ability to face PVE challenge decks where you can take your time, and really push yourself against an increasingly difficult set of AI combatants. You wouldn't have to deal with the issues PVP with a stranger has. But given that I already have an extremely powerful meta deck in four hours, there's no longer any point in playing PVP or even PVE. What do I have to prove? What do I have to gain? I already have all my hand traps, my boss monsters, my extra deck and negates. \\nThere's no more progression to be had, and no more content beyond endless PVP and basic PVE tutorials. Therefore, I can't really justify playing this game again.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1] Steps to win in YGO: Master Duels [/h1]\\n1. Play ranked\\n2. get matched with meta player that summons a shit ton of cards\\n3. disrupt one step in their setup\\n4. they disconnect\\n\\n[h1] Actual review: [/h1]\\nMaster Duels is a very nice video game version of YGO! It\\'s visually appealing, sound design is really cool, and it\\'s a lot of the controls are more refined than previous ygo video games, both fan made and official. I do wish they added more visual stuff like 3D models when summoning in duel links or legacy of the duelist or like the hovering 2d image above the special cards. Unlike duel links, you actually get to play the entirety of ygo. But like duel links, it\\'s still a gacha game. of course thats pretty much the essence of it irl but, ya know.\\n\\nContrary to popular belief, ygo is easy to learn. newer cards can intimidate new or returning players with their wall of text but that\\'s mostly [b] meta shit you DONT HAVE TO LEARN ASAP [/b] . start with the basic. this game\\'s tutorial does a great job explaining them. don\\'t know how to use any other extra deck cards other than fusion? that\\'s okay! learn it all here one by one. new and returning players are all welcome. dont want to learn them? well you just stay in your cave then and let others beat you to the ground.\\n\\nEven though this has micro transactions, building a deck viable for ranked is pretty simple. I\\'ve actually helped 2 of my friends build a deck within an hour. The game gives a shit ton of gems when you first boot it up so you can plan what ever deck you wanna build. Solo play also generous with gem rewards and also gives pretty good range of deck suggestions so i highly recommend playing it before going to ranked. In fact, some solo stories gives you a structure deck for finishing it. I also think this game has a more fair card scrapper and crafting. I\\'ve played Hearthstone for quite a while and that one really forces you to spend money to get a good deck and crafting cards is very ehhh. \\n\\nUnfortunately after the first few days of playing, the gem flow will slow down. rewards get smaller and smaller in the mission... for some reason... so building several decks is hard to do if you\\'re just F2P. So yeah that\\'s pretty much an obvious way of konami saying \"hey, it\\'s time for you to spend money on us\".\\n\\nI dont have much to say about the current state of ranked and balance cuz it varies from people to people. all i gotta say is, if you dont like the meta, get some friends to play with you (assuming your salty-ass has some lmao). I certainly do and i have a blast teaching them about my favorite childhood game!... and also giving them a beat down ( \\' v \\' )b\\n\\n[h1] Soooo. here\\'s the TL;DR: [/h1]\\n+ it\\'s easy to pick up\\n+ building decks is easy enough\\n+ visuals and audio is beautiful\\n- sorta encourages you to spend more after a day or two',\n",

       "  'review': 'As a TCG, Yugioh is undeniably extremely flawed. The humble beginnings of Yugioh included a resource system - Tribute summon monsters in order to produce more powerful monsters. \\n\\nIn the years following, however, Yugioh got away from any real resource cost to summon powerful monsters - every Yugioh deck for the last 15 years has revolved entirely around conditional Special Summoning to generate a powerful board state very very early and with monsters that would make an early Yugioh player gasp (\"wait - 4000 ATK.... and you have 3 of them? Turn 1?\").\\n\\nTo curtail the insane power of most decks in producing monsters, the disruptive effects available to players - spells and traps - are also obscenely powerful. Cards that say \"no\" in Yugioh are the strongest of any such card in any card game I\\'ve played. You can bring your opponent to a screeching halt - so long as you have the card that does so.\\n\\nThe result is - YGO is extremely high-octane. It is a practice of who produces and executes their (usually degenerative) gameplan first. It is the \"Marvel vs Capcom\" of trading card games, basically.\\n\\n...and it\\'s great for that, and YGO Master Duel is a superb and immensely impressive translation of Yugioh to the digital space. YGO Master Duel has every card and deck archetype I can think of - old classics like Monarchs, Gladiator Beasts, Dark World, Lightsworn, as well as BRAND NEW decks - all of these cards are here. The rewards you get for playing the game the first few days yield you an enormous amount of gems - more than enough to craft at least 1 actual meta deck if you so desire. I cannot fathom the work that went into translating the huge amount of rules on these cards into the game - but here it is - it works. This is what we always wanted, really, what any fan of Yugioh wanted all along. As a product, I have nothing at all bad to say about YGO Master Duel. As a card game... it\\'s Yugioh. At this point love it or leave it.',\n",

It\\'s also so annoying losing control during your own turn waiting on the opponent to decide if they want to do something.\\nGameplay: It\\'s not fun constantly getting negated, nor is it fun watching your opponent combo for 15 minutes setting up their massive board, just because you were unlucky to not have a negate yourself. You seriously might as well flip a coin to determine who wins the match. Here\\'s an example of a match. (You can\\'t mulligan btw)\\n\\n\"Hmm..my hand is pretty weak. No monsters to start my engine. Thankfully, I have a spell here that lets me fish for a monster that can get things going\"\\n*Opponent plays Ash Blossom from hand, negating the effect*\\n\"Oh that\\'s fun, I sure love hand traps. There is totally ways to play around CARDS THAT ARE IN THEIR HAND.\" GG I guess. Literally have to hope I top-deck something at this point. I\\'ll just surrender.\\n\\nMonetization: Everyone is praising Konami to the high heavens that they finally have a crafting system. Except nobody seems to mention that a huuuuge portion of decks are UR, and the rate that you get UR crafting points is abysmally low so you\\'re either going to have to spend a toooon of money finishing a single deck, or wait till you finish like 3 battlepasses (which would take a bit under a year considering each one lasts 75 days) just to finish crafting UR staples.\\n\\nCard Design: Yu-Gi-Oh should\\'ve implemented icons to shorten card effects YEARS ago. It\\'d be so much faster to have an icon of a graveyard or something to represent \"When this card is sent to the graveyard\" or \"If this card is in the graveyard. Instead, cards have paragraph long effects. Good luck remembering what 10k cards effects are, or have fun reading what they do every. single. time. Also, so many spells/effects/traps just boil down to - destroy X or negate Y. It\\'s BORING.\\n\\n\\nTL:DR - Play Legends of Runeterra instead. Better art, better card design, the flow of battle is more fast paced. The back and forth is actually fun and engaging not just negate negate negate GG. The monetization is EXTREMELY generous in LoR too.',\n",

Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped.

This set introduced the Infernoids, a series of monsters that can Special Summon themselves to the field by banishing other Infernoids from either the hand or graveyard. Notable cards in set include Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss, Qliphort Monolith, Uni-Zombie, Nephe Shaddoll Fusion, and a card that would bolster Satellarknight to combat the Burning Abyss Shaddoll meta, Stellarknight Constellar Diamond. In this series, both Nyhmnim and myself will be opening 24 booster packs or 1 box of a core Yu-Gi-Oh! booster set. We will build a deck and play a best 2 out of 3, and the winner will receive a small prize to upgrade their deck. HOWEVER! Each episode, we will open another box of the next set that was released moving in chronological order, constantly upgrading our decks before dueling each other at the end of each episode. This is the Yu-Gi-Oh! Progression Series.',\n",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'If you love dueling the same copy pasted decks over and over again as well as enjoy waiting 10 minutes to take your turn you\\'ll love this game. The community really needs to have some originality when making their decks instead of using the same meta decks over and over again just to get clapped. F2P friendly at first until your load of gems start drying up and the game barely gives you any after your first two days of playing. Not worth putting your time into when getting Platinum 1 is too easy to get and there\\'s literally nothing else the game offers you. The fact you can\\'t just build your own deck for free to play with against just your friends is ridiculous. This game screams \"give me money\". It\\'s not worth it when the only thing this game offers is ranked duel. Hard pass. Duelists of the Roses on the PS2 is a far superior game than whatever money grabbing game this is.',\n",

At first I was a little worried that it looked so much like hearthstone, I\\'m not a fan of that game to be honest and it seemed to be missing some of the anime story elements of Duel Links but after playing for a couple of hours I really think this is a fun game. I love the crafting system and how many rewards you get from the missions... it really doesn\\'t feel like a CASH GRAB and sometimes Duel Links very much does. You won\\'t have to empty your wallet to get the deck you want and for me that is really what won me over as a new player. Ranked is challenging but entertaining and I can continue to see myself trying to climb the latter. ONLY NEGATIVE for me personally is I WISH THE CARDS HAD HOLOGRAMS. Duel Links did and it\\'s a mobile game, the whole \"mate\" thing is cute but the show was known for Holos and I really think they could have implemented them here but just chose not to but I can let that slide.',\n",

It's sweaty playing this game as it is.

[/b]\\n\\nHonestly, between waiting 10 minutes for your opponent to play their entire deck, summon and resummon the same monster in order to summon and resummon another monster, and then getting to your turn and realizing you are facing down 5 monsters with 3000+ attack because you clocked out minutes ago when you realized you drew a shitty hand but were hoping to draw something that might help, [u] this game is the epitomy of everything wrong with YGO. [/u]\\n\\nThere should be rules and card exemptions for ranked (but we all know there won't be because there is hardly any card rotation in this game). There should be game modes for different generations (no mixing xyz/synchro/link/pendulum). Rank means nothing if its a free for all. \\n\\nThe fact of the matter is that this game is at its most fun when you and your opponent run ridiculous, niche decks and have a great back and forth, where it is an equal playing playing ground. \\n\\nI don't understand the people praising the solo mode. A lot of these battles are the same 10-min turn fiascos as in rated, but these battles at least go faster because there are no connection issues and the AI won't purposefully stall to piss you off.\\n\\nAs a longtime fan and player of the card game, I thought this would be THE simulator we have all been waiting for. I would have been willing to spend money on this game if they put any thought into gaming modes and flow. \\n\\nI can't recommend this game. You will end up wasting 20+ hours like me with little show for it but frustration.\",\n",

Let me preface this by saying that I\\'ve sunk hours into this game and hit platinum every season I\\'ve played (III, I, I). \\n\\nYou are playing against the same 3-4 meta decks in ranked and rarely come across anything unique. So if you want to try out a new deck, you\\'re screwed. This could be fixed by having a non-ranked multiplayer mode (no the room/table mode doesn\\'t count) so that everyone is not try-harding to get to Plat 1.  \\n\\nA ban-list of overpowered, game breaking cards are a joke at this point. I don\\'t know why this game doesn\\'t follow the TCG ban list, that would be too good of an idea I guess. Its hard for a newbie to \"git gud\" when you can\\'t even play your first turn. \\n\\nOh, and the bots........ Those damn BOTS! This game is running rampant with them in ranked mode. I don\\'t even see this being addressed at all from the devs. Tired of dealing with all of this and tired of waiting for Konami. \\n\\n[u]Games are suppose to be fun.[/u] Deleting this game and never turning back.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Master Duel is currently the best iteration of an official online YGO card game. Unlike Duel Links, MD follows the physical TCG rulings and comes with a near complete pool of cards from the TCG. One thing to note is that they have their own banlist, which is closer to the OCG banlist than the TCG one, albeit still slightly different.\\n\\nLet\\'s first talk about the game economy. You get a fairly decent starting funds to build a 2-3 decks when you start the game, but it becomes rather slow to build decks after you exhaust your \"new player funds\". There is also a high rarity staple cards hurdle you have to get over to make your deck competitive, with the upside being that once you get over that hurdle, it\\'s fairly easy to build future decks. Seasonal events are also fairly generous in rewards, so overall I\\'d say the game economy feels rather okay as you can build a new deck or two every month.\\n\\nNext, let\\'s talk about the gameplay. Unfortunately, as of now there isn\\'t really any unranked format or a casual mode, outside of private matches. So if you want to use the matchmaking, you\\'re forced to go into ranked. There has been a number of complaints about the state of the meta and about the matchmaking in general, as there aren\\'t enough ranks to properly distribute the skill level of the players. The game also prevents you from ranking down before the end of season. So if you climbed to the highest rank, then you are stuck with sweaty meta tryhards in that rank for the rest of the season... which is why they either need to expand their ranking system or just create a more casual game mode, outside of events.\\n\\nTL:DR the game has a good start and can be decently entertaining without forcing you to spend money, but otherwise feels very incomplete in terms of features and gameplay. I\\'m hopeful that Konami expands on MD as it has a great potential as a CCG.',\n",

Pretty much all the players I've encountered spend almost 10 min just playing combo cards one after another, which ends in them summoning 1 or more level 10 monster within their first turn, while also having at least other 3 lower level monsters, giving you 0 chance of fighting back, let alone enjoy the duel.\\n\\nLike I said, with the gems they give at the beginning, you can built a decent deck, but there's still no chance to go against the endless number of combos most players use.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"- flawed af mechanics that allow 1 turn decks\\n\\n- no quickplay mode or any general modes other than ranks\\n\\n- no rewards at all if you lose, which if you're starting out and you're in bronze and silver, coming across 1 turn decks and general scum decks is far too common\\n\\n- game is deceptive, rewards you alot to begin with and then alot less. these practices to entice new players to play again is just deceptive as hell\\n\\n- turn limits are essentially unrestricted, you could probably watch the lord of the rings extended trilogy by the time you will have your next turn and youd be facing like 4 syncho/effect monsters that you can essentially do nothing about because its 1st/2nd turn and their effects block every single kinda bullshit you can possibly think of \\n\\n- game has no region locks whatsoever, so prepare to come across hackers. its too much of a coincidence to have 5 spells/traps on the field, and every time for some region guy to instantly pick out the ones that defend your monsters from being destroyed and leave me with shit that just yeah. and i know what hacks are out there, seeing your opponents cards is prob the most common one to get away with.. \\n\\n- This has less content than duel links does by a farrrrr margin imo. so prob gonna go back to duel links. \\n\\n- play meta decks is basically required. there is NO serious way to not play a meta based deck and not have like a W/L of like fkin 1/20. Ive won more times from bot players than I have from genuine players and Ive played 122 duels as of this point. \\n\\n\\nTIPS:\\n- just surrender more often, its a waste of your time to play a match against a 1 turn deck or let scumbag players boost a card to 10k damage on the 2nd fucking turn, even if you might live that turn. \\n- theres too many bots in this game, just watch movies or anime or whatever tf weeb shit you do while playing this or you're gonna get pissed off and write a fuckin ted talk script of a review.\\nthanks for coming to my ted talk.\",\n",

In plat its pretty much the only decks that are in play. With it the gems that F2P players are given to you are pretty much nothing. a max of 150 Gems per day if you grind ranked.  with it compared to there other Free to play game duel links you get a 10 pull when a new set come out and with other Free to play games (example genshin impact) when patches/maintenance you get a almost 3-5 pulls. Lastly with this current patch they raised the price of the battle pass from 600 to 800 with pretty much the same thing. \\n\\nman i had such high hopes for this game but with the FTK's. unbreakable boards and konamis complete and utter stingyness with the amount of gems that are given vs the amount of gems needed this game is kinda bad\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I love this card game. It's not an overstating it to say that both the anime and the game itself have been core memories to me. It's no secret however, that due to both of these things being linked to what is supposed to be in infinitely merchandisable card game; the game costs money. It's just disparaging to see how much it costs and how much the system is made down to it's core to drain every dollar from you. You'd think that with the many Yu-Gi-Oh! simulators online they'd understand the appeal of a virtual simulator being in that the cards are cheaper and more attainable. Simply put my big issue is your inability to ACTUALLY recycle the points and cards. I understand its novel to have a simulator in where you have to purchase packs just like in real life, it does a lot to make winning with the cards you were limited to use feel better. But the UR packs being so expensive (1000? was 500? to difficult?) is downright manipulative. It's unironically 23$ for the chance of an UR, cause again it's not certain. Compounding with the cards themselves being random. It's not only possible but common that you'll buy a 10 pack and get an UR for a pack that wasn't even featured in your desired booster pack. Pair this with you only being able trade in cards for a third of the card points necessary to generate new ones. Culminates in a game that objectively costs more then it's worth to play. You'll find yourself scrambling for points and CP just to run decks you actually like. A simpler fix would be allocating the Card Points system to rarity. Making it so that if you get an UR it costs 30+ points when sold, as they are the rarest and would be the hardest for the consumer to lose and burn up. 20+ for SR and then 15+ for R and 10+ etc. This way even if you get a card you can't use. Your a lot more likely to recycle it into a card you want to use. Especially if that card is some sort of rare boss monster like the hundreds that exist. This isn't even getting to the bugs, like certain cards effects not procking correctly or just not working when their requirements have objectively been met. I'm not even going to complain about the Meta of the game, in which decks are made almost always in one turn consistently negate every effect you have. Being a turn based game I think it's important to stress how boring it can be when player interactions are one sided. The problem isn't that someone is winning or even winning considerably. But that the other player isn't allowed to do anything at all. If monster effects and hand traps are allowed to be so rampant that you literally can't activate anything with a great hand then the game just becomes indistinguishable from a single player game. The meta isn't even worth mentioning as it's a direct by-product of everyone being so starved for cards their pushed to favor cards that keep them winning. If not for the dopamine cycle then for the chance of getting their money back. Of course the meta is filled with Drytron's and Elditch if you have to choose the cards you want and those cards are the fastest and most consistent way to win. It's not on the players it's systemic problem with the game forcing them to fight like wolves for scraps. All in all while the game itself is fun to play an filled with tons of combinations of cards and combos to have great plays and fun times. The bar to entry is very expensive. Despite being a free game.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This is hands down the best digital collectible card game, that is if you're willing to put the time and patience necessary on it. If you want to play this mindlessly, you will get wrecked. \\n\\nThe amount of free gems given to you by playing solo mode and completing missions is enough to build 2 or even 3 decent decks. You need to spend your gems carefully. Find a cheap viable deck you like then evolve it into a better deck. I started playing gem knights because i found it in the master duel meta webpage, climbed up to gold+ with it, then the next step was to craft an adamancipators deck. Climbed up to to the highest rank which is platinum 1. And enjoyed most of the climb. You need to buy the secret packs corresponding to the cards you want, then destroy every card you don't want to get CP to craft the ones you need. (Meta revolves around handtraps and combo decks). Crafting your deck takes time and patience, but damn you get that dopamine rush when you play ranked and it is 100% worth it. Also the solo mode is very entertaining and rewarding/challenging too. You can use it to practice your decks before you get into ranked, then start duelling people.\\n\\nEven so, if you want to play a different deck you just create a new account. That way i've been able to play 7 decks in 3 different accounts, a pair of accounts in gold and this one in plat 1. If you want to play a cheap anti-meta deck tho, i recommend playing a true draco deck.\\n\\nIt's amazing to be able to climb to the highest rank without spending one penny, unlike in hearthstone where you have to spend money or play for months to have a decent deck. There are MANY decks, some dirty ones like drytron or eldlich that makes you feel good if you beat them. And then some other ones not so common than when you see them you'll enjoy the game even if you lose just by watching the combos.\\n\\nIf you gonna play this, pick a deck, build it and enjoy it. You won't regret it.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This is coming from someone who hasn't seriously played Yugioh since the mid 2000s\\n\\nThis is a really well built game. Almost every card is in, the animations are flashy but not intrusive (with an option to disable key card animations), and the OST is full of bangers. The solo mode is very cool, it shows you the lore behind some archetypes as well as give you a general idea of how to play them, then gives you a starter deck for that archetype.\\n\\nIt's fairly f2p friendly too in the sense that you get a lot of gems for starting out, and it's enough to make enough cards for a good deck. However the crafting system for cards is pretty awful, and still requires you to pull ultra rare cards if you want to craft cards of the that rarity. If they had a system where you can at least trade crafting points from one rarity for another that would be good.\\n\\nWhere this game falters though is in regards to pvp. It needs to introduce players to handtraps (negation effects you can activate from your hand). If your deck can't interrupt plays from your hand you're gonna get stomped by any meta deck that can set up an unbeatable board turn 1. This is a super important part of pvp but the game never tells you it, nor gives you cards but rather you need to spend a lot of ultra rare currency to get them.\\n\\nI think if you like the cards, music, and have enough patience to learn which cards you should autoinclude in decks to prevent degenerate combos this game can be a great experience for you. Otherwise I would stay away or just play solo or w/ friends.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'The game itself is visually very nice, awesome graphics, cosmetics, pictures, interface and all (pls add cubic boss monster a summon animation monkas :\\'c ). But it is missing in a lot of other things: \\n1) Shortcuts and tools for the deck building phase (simulator like keybinds to add, search cards ecc.) and it also misses some decks and cards (floowandereeze, despia ecc.). \\n2) Surely the thing that i\\'m missing the most in this game is the bo3 format ( especially using side deck, having a chance to play full matchups changing cards from game 1 to game 2 ecc.) that, in my opinion, is one of the most crucial strategic parts in the game (it\\'s not really fun to play competitive ygo in only 1 game maybe against a counter matchup not going 1st and not having the chance to play at all, thing that is fixed in irl format with bo3 and side decking). \\n3) The banlist itself does not make any sense to me, there is an official tcg/ocg banlist, why not using that? Instead i find questionable the game\\'s banlist choices by konami (ex. 3x maxx c while that card has been banned in ages in the irl format, or vfd ecc.). \\n4) I think that it makes no sense from the players to cry about ranked games on stuff like: long turns, game is unfair, \"why can\\'t my 6yrs old lightsworn synchro elementary school champion deck win nowdays\" ecc. I mean the game evolved in yrs and now it is complicated and long, adapt to it or leave my guy, but it\\'s true that it misses a casual mode for testing stuff and having fun, maybe a 2v2 tag duel mode, choosing old formats themed duels, being able to choose bo1 or bo3, what banlist to use, time limits  ecc. (all this not as events but as something you can always choose to play casual/for fun if you don\\'t wanna rank and play meta).\\n 5) The ranked system is really bad imo, I got plat1 in ~20 hours of game with a simple qliporth deck not even using meta stuff (i\\'ve been playing the game since ygogx in competitive format). Maybe add a rank above Plat or a sort of high elo monthly league/tournament with top ranked players to raise the challenge. \\n6) I can\\'t really complain about gems system and stuff cause you can have about 3/4 decks if you manage gems properly and craft staples early, but still it\\'s pretty boring after a bit and it requires you to shop gems to have 10+ working decks. (or clearing every single solo and play 24/7 to have a fifth if you don\\'t want to spend money). \\n7) I can understand why there is no in-game talk/chat option in ranked games ( XD ), but they could add a voice chat / texting system at least for friends and friendly matches, otherwise i find the friend add mechanic pretty useless.\\nIn conclusion the game is pretty much new but i feel like it is losing hype and player base for these reasons, it has so much potential and with some work it could be a pretty good ygo competitive game. For now i would not recommend to play it an invest so much time and money, when you can have infinite decks and better working mechanics in any other simulator for free (if ur not obsessed with stuff like cool graphics and opening packs).',\n",

I was really wishing that since Konami released an official game that they'd fixed things. most of the time you won't be able to play the game because 1 or 2 powerful effects that omni negate or just wipe the entire field or hand of cards to use. Cards have been removed from the ban list that were plausibly banned for 10 or so years, some of them even longer. With the amount of time that is required to understand this game and the meta; to finally understand it and still get destroyed by 2 cards is absolutely infuriating.\",\n",

There's no box updates twice a month so you don't feel like you're always in a rush which is something I love. Major updates and events are a bit sparse right now, but the game is still new and should be treated as such. \\n\\nBuying gems is extremely expensive imo, but as long as they keep regular gem rewards consistent it's fine.\\n\\nOverall Master Duel is great right now so if you like to play Yu-Gi-Oh! then play it.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Basically if you want to play casually, if you're new or are someone who watched only the original Yugioh and want to play out of nostalgia(with decks containing only the old cards), it can be extremely frustrating and if you're unlucky with the opponents you get, even boring. If you don't know or want to use any of these newer cards and unfair play styles, you will essentially just wait 10 minutes for your opponent to summon half his deck. And when it's finally your turn, everything you try will most likely be negated and you're done. Also, the only way to make your own deck is to play ranked, where you will most likely just end up playing someone with one of those broken decks 4/5 times. It's great for a nostalgia pop but otherwise not so much unless you're very, very, very lucky with your opponents.\",\n",

Now, five thousand years later, a boy named Yuugi unlocks the secret of the Millennium Puzzle. He is infused with ancient magical energies, for destiny has chosen him to defend the world from the return of the Shadow Games, just as the brave Pharaoh did five thousand years ago.\\n\\n[Cue themesong]\\n\\n[Cut to the school, Yuugi and Joey are playing a card game with a group of students around them]\\n\\nYuugi: Hey Joey!

Let's go!\\n\\nYuugi: Okay, maybe I could even get my Grandpa to show us this super rare card he's got.\\n\\nSeto: Rare card? Could they have found the card that I've been searching for?\\n\\n[Cut to the Turtle Game Shop]\\n\\nYuugi: Grandpa? I'm home.\\n\\nSolomon: And I see you've brought company.\\n\\nYuugi: Gramps, could you show my friends your awesome, super rare card?\\n\\nSolomon: Rare card? My special card? Hmmm...\\n\\nYuugi: Please! Please!\\n\\nJoey: Pretty please?\\n\\nSolomon: Hmmm... Hah hah! How could I refuse? You kids are in for a treat. I don't take this card out too often. Ready? Here it is.\\nThe Blue-Eyes White Dragon, so rare, so powerful, I never let it leave my hands.\\n\\nJoey: Awesome!\\n\\nTristan: [snatches the BEWD out of Solomon's hands] It doesn't look all that special to me...\\n\\nSolomon: Ahh! This card is priceless. There are only four of them in all the world.\\n\\nJoey: Speaking of priceless, I'm ready to trade!\\n\\nSolomon: Not for this card.\\n\\nJoey: Huh? Nah, I didn't mean that card. I meant, show me some other cool cards to get me started.\\n\\n[The door opens, enter Seto Kaiba]\\n\\nSolomon: Hello, can I help you?\\n\\nTéa: Huh?\\n\\nSeto: If you can't, it certainly wouldn't surprise me.\\n\\nYuugi: Seto Kaiba!\\n\\nJoey: Kaiba?!\\n\\nTristan: Doesn't he have a big fancy company to run? What's he doing down here?\\n\\nSeto: Not that it's any of your business, but I came to see the card.\\n\\nJoey: [smiles and steps forward] Hey, are you into Duel Monsters too? This is perfect. Maybe we could all duel together sometime.\\n\\nSeto: [walks into the shop] Me? Duel you? I'd have more of a challenge playing solitaire.\\n\\nJoey: What?\\n\\nSeto: I am the number one ranked duelist in the country, and the favorite to win the Duel Monsters championship. Hah, you wouldn't last two minutes in a duel against me.\\n\\nJoey: [clenches fist] Ooh, I'm shaking. Maybe you'd like to settle this with fists instead of cards.\\n\\nYuugi: Whoa! Take it easy, Joey.\\n\\nJoey: But Yuugi, Kaiba's asking for it.\\n\\nSeto: Now does this shop have any worthwhile cards or not? [catches sight of the BEWD, lurches forward] Can it be? The Blue-Eyes White Dragon in a dump like this? It is. The card I've been searching for.\\n\\nSolomon: [covers the BEWD] Well, enough window shopping. Is there anything else I can help you with?\\n\\nSeto: [growls, lifts his briefcase onto the counter and opens it]\\n\\nSolomon: Huh? Oooh.\\n\\nSeto: Listen to me, old man. Gimme your Blue-Eyes White Dragon card and I'll trade you all of these.\\n\\nAll: Whoa!\\n\\nSolomon: Ahh, nice. But no thanks.\\n\\nAll: Huh?!\\n\\nSeto: Nngh. Fine. If you won't trade, maybe you'll sell it. Name your price. I can pay anything you ask.\\n\\nSolomon: I'm sure you could. But this card is worth more than you could ever offer. Not because of its power or because it's so rare, but because of what it means to me. This card was given to me by a dear friend and so I treasure this card as I do that friend. So parting with it is completely out of the question.\\n\\nSeto: No!\\n\\nYuugi: You'd feel the same even if it were a common card, right Grandpa?\\n\\nSolomon: Exactly. You see, this precious card has bonded with my heart.\\n\\nSeto: Fine! I've heard enough of your nonsense. [closes briefcase and walks away] Senile old fool.\\n\\n[Cut to exterior of Game Shop, a car drives away]\\n\\n[Cut to interior of the car]\\n\\nSeto: Heart of the cards. Ridiculous. Cards are all about power. And one way or another, his Blue-Eyes White Dragon card... will be mine.\\n\\n[Cut to exterior of the KaibaCorp building]\\n\\nSeto: Gentlemen, there's a little something I'd like you to pick up for me at the Game Shop.\\n\\nLackey: Gladly, Master Kaiba.\\n\\n[Cut to the exterior of the Game Shop, two men step in front of the camera]\\n\\n[Cut to interior of the Game Shop. Solomon is standing in front of the counter]\\n\\nSolomon: Good morning. [turns around] Hmm?\\n\\nLackey: [steps forward] My master, Seto Kaiba, challenges you to a duel. You may come with us now.\\n\\nSolomon: And if I were to decline?\\n\\nLackey: [glasses glint ominously] I'm afraid I must... insist.\\n\\nSolomon: Young Kaiba doesn't understand. But I'll teach him a lesson about the heart of the cards.\\n\\n[Cut to street]\\n\\nJoey: Man, I hope he has some cool cards today.\\n\\nYuugi: Me too!\\n\\nTéa: Yeah!\\n\\n[Cut to Game Shop]\\n\\nJoey: Okay Gramps, I'm back to get more cards. Hey, hey Gramps!\\n\\nYuugi: Grandpa, I'm home.\\n\\nTéa: Maybe he... went out?\\n\\nJoey: Maybe. But why would he leave the door unlocked?\\n\\n[a phone rings]\\n\\nYuugi: [picks it up] Hello. Game Shop.\\n\\nSeto: *Ahh, Yuugi. Perfect.*\\n\\nYuugi: Kaiba?!\\n\\nSeto: Your grandfather's here visiting. But he's not feeling well. Why don't you come by my office and pick him up.\\n\\nYuugi: Kaiba! What've you done, Kaiba?!\\n\\n[Cut to KaibaCorp building]\\n\\n[Yuugi, Téa, Joey, and Tristan run into an elevator]\\n\\n[Cut to upper floor of KaibaCorp, the elevator opens and Yuugi runs out]\\n\\nYuugi: Grandpa! Grandpa. A-are you okay?\\n\\nSolomon: [props himself up on his elbows] Yuugi. I failed. I wanted to teach that boy Kaiba a lesson about the heart of the cards, but I lost. [groans]\\n\\nYuugi: Grandpa!\\n\\nSeto: How's the old man feeling, hmmm?\\n\\nJoey: Kaiba, you sleeze. What've you done to him?\\n\\nSeto: We had a duel, that's all. With each of us putting up our most valuable card as the prize. But I guess playing against a champion like myself was just too much stimulation for the old fool.\\n\\nTéa: [points at Seto] Kaiba, you should be ashamed of yourself.\\n\\nSeto: It was fair. [holds up the BEWD] And look at the sweet prize I won. [begins tearing it up]\\nAll: [gasp]\\n\\nYuugi: Grandpa's most treasured card!\\n\\nSeto: Yes, the Blue-Eyes White Dragon is a rare and powerful card and this one will never be used against me.\\n\\nSolomon: Ahh, my Blue-Eyes White Dragon. My treasure.\\n\\nYuugi: Grandpa! Hold on. [looks up at Seto] How could you do such a thing?\\n\\nSolomon: Yuugi, here. [holds up Duel Monsters deck] Take this.\\n\\nYuugi: Huh? Grandpa.\\n\\nSolomon: I built this deck. I put my soul in these cards. And I taught you everything I know, Yuugi. Take them. Take my cards and teach him respect. Teach Kaiba respect for the heart of the cards, Yuugi.\\n\\nYuugi: But Grandpa, you need help. I've got to get you to a doctor.\\n\\nSeto: That sounds like an excuse. Your friends can care for your grandfather while you and I duel.... unless you're afraid?\",\n",

This set introduced the Infernoids, a series of monsters that can Special Summon themselves to the field by banishing other Infernoids from either the hand or graveyard. Notable cards in set include Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss, Qliphort Monolith, Uni-Zombie, Nephe Shaddoll Fusion, and a card that would bolster Satellarknight to combat the Burning Abyss Shaddoll meta, Stellarknight Constellar Diamond. In this series, both Nyhmnim and myself will be opening 24 booster packs or 1 box of a core Yu-Gi-Oh! booster set. We will build a deck and play a best 2 out of 3, and the winner will receive a small prize to upgrade their deck. HOWEVER! Each episode, we will open another box of the next set that was released moving in chronological order, constantly upgrading our decks before dueling each other at the end of each episode.

       "  'review': \"so far this game is pretty good, f2p-friendly as well. You can get around 130 gems /day only from daily missions, which is higher than most games since you only need 100 gems to pull any pack. The first event (xyz festival) also gives us quite a lot of gems, around 2Kish in total, and thats like 2 multi of packs. i'm a returning player from 5ds era, and the last yugioh game i played was yugioh gx in ps2, the tutorial helped a lot with learning most of the new stuff (pendulum, xyz, link). However, it can still be improved especially about links, this game need to explain more about it (Co-link, the link arrows, etc.). They also need to add a casual matchmaking for this game, since right now the only matchmaking we have is ranked only (so we can practice decks or just have fun with random deck). I only have around 80 hours on steam since i mostly play on my phone (honestly it's not that optimized on phone, but still playable. It drains phone battery too much and the resolution isn't that great)\\n\\nSo far this game is a must play if you like to play yugioh.\",\n",

Make a single UR/SR from the pack and open some packs for it\\n\\nCons\\n-Gold onwards requires meta deck(which not only can change but can also be hard to make) to be capable to play\\n-Decks require focus otherwise you won't be able to get a well functional deck\\n-Some of the gated challenges are extremely hard(such as one was an expert of getting several 10k monsters within 5 turns or a perfect counter when I needed a good play to beat over something and before asked this was with my ranked deck so the deck was very effective)\\n-What you run is basically decided for you by the game based on what secret packs it opens up\\n\\nNeutral\\n-Game incentives go down as you go. On one hand you miss out on less for missing an event or start it much later then others but also on the other hand who wants to get 10k(50 match victories) points for 50 gems(not too much an exaggeration with level 50 on player being only a single legacy pack which by that point you'll have basically everything there anyway)\\n-If you get cards from structure/legacy packs you can't get rid of your copies over 3(yes I have two different cards at 5 and 4 respectively and I will only get more examples as I play)\\n\\nThings that would be good\\n-Token exchanges(do note even with playing for a month and having a bunch of R tokens at 50:1 I still can only make 60(2 cards) 100 if at 30:1 SR tokens)\\n-Steam Friends show in list(Yes this annoys me. It is less about not being able to add them but more I have to go ask them for their ID individually when both are in theory having our accounts linked with steam opposed to it registering just period unlike games such as Rocket League that do a internal list as well)\",\n",

The banlist is the same as the Official card game, And certain strategies are toxic to the game, Some cards that shouldn't be used are completly usable in the game. The TCG formats are proof that this is a threat to the community.\\n\\n- Card Carfting, It is a relief to change cards to Crafting Points (CP) but the amount of the Points you will get from the exchange of a card is quite useless compared to the amount of points you will need to get a card via Crafting Points.\\n\\nKonami must fix these issues ASAP while there is a problem with the game.\",\n",

The Amount of toxicity In the review section speaks for itself, calling anyone who talks negatively about the game as \"yugi boomers\" or \"noobs\" even though some of them are actually rogue  or meta players they then Defend A cardgame that kills you on turn 1 or stops you from interacting on turn 2 even though you have 3 hand traps or quick-play spells  , reading the cards and learning your opponent\\'s deck wont help much either as the probability of getting the cards you need is on a 33% ( yes Its true you can simply look it up on yu-gi-oh forums) the only way for you to have fun is either play with your friends and don\\'t interact with rank or join the meta slaves as making rogue or meme decks is only going to punish you for not bringing hand-trap , quick-play spells or waste your resources like gems and craftable materials. \\n\\nthe Rank of Platinum is now shit along with Gold as most meta Platinum players don\\'t want to rank up to get those sweet gems and not fight anymore elditch or Drytron and terrorize any Rogue or lesser tier decks that don\\'t run much counterplay. \\n\\nIf you\\'re into being a meta slave and competitive play then play this game, if you\\'re into making mediocre experimental / rogue fun decks then I do not recommend this game .\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'As a Yugioh boomer it pains me to see things such as OTK and FTK decks being as common and rampant as they are. Not being able to play the game simply because you went second or because you had a bad first hand is a horrible experience to go through. The only way to have fun is to take the fun away from someone else. Thus, having fun is akin to bullying your opponent. There is no such thing as \"heart of the cards\" anymore. There is no more believing that you can make it through this turn and hopefully draw what you need next turn. There are only negates. Hand negates, trap card negates, monster effect negates, cards like Skill Drain that negate cards that haven\\'t even been played yet. Along with this, even though it\\'s par for the course, everything worth playing is a UR, so players are forced to either grind through the hellscape that is ranked or empty their wallets in order to build the decks that they want, and to especially build the decks that can compete. Unless of course your first and only deck is a meta one, in which case, I guess you will enjoy being the bully and reveling in the pain of your opponent. This may just be the ramblings of a sore loser that refuses and can\\'t afford the meta since I made other decks that interested me, but all I can say is that the saving grace of this game is just dueling your friends in private matches, where we can play the decks we want and not worry about the ranked meta.',\n",

       "  'review': \"This game is a great Yu-Gi-Oh game, but it suffers greatly from having players online who take 5 minutes on their turns so duels can get extremely boring because the other player is taking forever on their turn. If you're gonna play this game for the sake of dueling randos online, just know you're gonna need a lot of patience, despite the fact that there's a supposed timer for people to adhere by. I feel like the timer should be more limited than allowing each player 8 minutes per turn. If this were real life and you were taking 5-7 minutes on your turn, nobody would want anything to do with you. Lol.\\n\\nOther than a terrible online experience, the game is fairly giving with the gems you need to purchase card packs, so it's not terribly difficult to collect the cards. And there's a solo mode that allows you to glimpse into the backstories and lore of certain cards. It also gives you rewards in the form of cards, gems, and icons/mates/etc. My main beef with this game is the online mode against random people, which is where a free competitive card game like this should shine.\",\n",

The way the handle things is awful.\\nThe game can be enjoyable but Konami's greed is a real problem. I know and understand that people spending money in the game is important as it should but :\\n1. The prices are too high.\\n2. The perks of doing good in the game are non-existent.\\n3. And now they have limited the ways to manage to circumvent that by failing on purpose without giving you the incentive to not fail but succeed.\\nThis will stay at non-recommended and advice you to find other ways to enjoy Yu-Gi-Oh! until Konami fixes the game. It is ridiculous to reset Ranked Seasons in such a way that you lose rewards by being a top player. It is just ridiculous.\",\n",
